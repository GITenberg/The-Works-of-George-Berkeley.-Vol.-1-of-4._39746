        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More than thirty
        years ago I was honoured by a request to prepare a complete edition
        of the Works of Bishop Berkeley, with Notes, for the Clarendon Press,
        Oxford. That edition, which contains many of his writings previously
        unpublished, appeared in 1871. It was followed in 1874 by a volume of
        annotated Selections from his philosophical works; and in 1881 I
        prepared a small volume on <span class="tei tei-q">“Berkeley”</span>
        for Blackwood's <span class="tei tei-q">“Philosophical
        Classics.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The 1871 edition
        of the Works originated, I believe, in an essay on <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Real World of Berkeley,”</span> which I gave to
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macmillan's
        Magazine</span></span> in 1862, followed by another in 1864, in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">North
        British Review</span></span>. These essays suggested advantages to
        contemporary thought which might be gained by a consideration of
        final questions about man and the universe, in the form in which they
        are presented by a philosopher who has suffered more from
        misunderstanding than almost any other modern thinker. During a part
        of his lifetime, he was the foremost metaphysician in Europe in an
        unmetaphysical generation. And in this country, after a revival of
        philosophy in the later part of the eighteenth century, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">matter</span></em>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">substance</span></em>, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>,
        and other terms which play an important part in his writings, had
        lost the meaning that he intended; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> while in Germany the sceptical speculations of
        David Hume gave rise to a reconstructive criticism, on the part of
        Kant and his successors, which seemed at the time to have little
        concern with the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>
        methods and the principles of Berkeley.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The success of the
        attempt to recall attention to Berkeley has far exceeded expectation.
        Nearly twenty thousand copies of the three publications mentioned
        above have found their way into the hands of readers in Europe and
        America; and the critical estimates of Berkeley, by eminent writers,
        which have appeared since 1871, in Britain, France, Germany, Denmark,
        Holland, Italy, America, and India, confirm the opinion that his
        Works contain a word in season, even for the twentieth century. Among
        others who have delivered appreciative criticisms of Berkeley within
        the last thirty years are J.S. Mill, Mansel, Huxley, T.H. Green,
        Maguire, Collyns Simon, the Right Hon. A.J. Balfour, Mr. Leslie
        Stephen, Dr. Hutchison Stirling, Professor T.K. Abbott, Professor Van
        der Wyck, M. Penjon, Ueberweg, Frederichs, Ulrici, Janitsch, Eugen
        Meyer, Spicker, Loewy, Professor Höffding of Copenhagen, Dr. Lorenz,
        Noah Porter, and Krauth, besides essays in the chief British,
        Continental, and American reviews. The text of those Works of
        Berkeley which were published during his lifetime, enriched with a
        biographical Introduction by Mr. A.J. Balfour, carefully edited by
        Mr. George Sampson, appeared in 1897. In 1900 Dr. R. Richter, of the
        University of Leipsic, produced a new translation into German of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogues
        between Hylas and Philonous</span></span>, with an <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> excellent Introduction and notes. These
        estimates form a remarkable contrast to the denunciations, founded on
        misconception, by Warburton and Beattie in the eighteenth
        century.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1899 I was
        unexpectedly again asked by the Delegates of the Oxford University
        Press to prepare a New Edition of Berkeley's Works, with some account
        of his life, as the edition of 1871 was out of print; a circumstance
        which I had not expected to occur in my lifetime. It seemed
        presumptuous to undertake what might have been entrusted to some one
        probably more in touch with living thought; and in one's
        eighty-second year, time and strength are wanting for remote
        research. But the recollection that I was attracted to philosophy
        largely by Berkeley, in the morning of life more than sixty years
        ago, combined with the pleasure derived from association in this way
        with the great University in which he found an academic home in his
        old age, moved me in the late evening of life to make the attempt.
        And now, at the beginning of the twentieth century, I offer these
        volumes, which still imperfectly realise my ideal of a final Oxford
        edition of the philosopher who spent his last days in Oxford, and
        whose mortal remains rest in its Cathedral.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since 1871
        materials of biographical and philosophical interest have been
        discovered, in addition to the invaluable collection of MSS. which
        Archdeacon Rose then placed at my disposal, and which were included
        in the supplementary volume of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Life and Letters</span></span>. Through the
        kindness of the late Earl of Egmont I had access, some years ago, to
        a large <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg
        viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        number of letters which passed between his ancestor, Sir John
        (afterwards Lord) Percival, and Berkeley, between 1709 and 1730. I
        have availed myself freely of this correspondence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some interesting
        letters from and concerning Berkeley, addressed to his friend Dr.
        Samuel Johnson of Stratford in Connecticut, afterwards President of
        King's College in New York, appeared in 1874, in Dr. Beardsley's
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life of
        Johnson</span></span>, illustrating Berkeley's history from 1729 till
        his death. For these and for further information I am indebted to Dr.
        Beardsley.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the present
        edition of Berkeley's Works, the Introductions and the annotations
        have been mostly re-written. A short account of his romantic life is
        prefixed, intended to trace its progress in the gradual development
        and application of his initial Principle; and also the external
        incidents of his life in their continuity, with the help of the new
        material in the Percival MSS. and the correspondence with Johnson. It
        forms a key to the whole. This biography is not intended to supersede
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life
        and Letters</span></span> of Berkeley that accompanied the 1871
        edition, which remains as a magazine of facts for reference.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rearrangement
        of the Works is a feature in the present edition. Much of the new
        material that was included in the 1871 edition reached me when the
        book was far advanced in the press, and thus the chronological
        arrangement, strictly followed in the present edition, was not
        possible. A chronological arrangement is suggested by Berkeley
        himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“I <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> could wish that all the things I have published
        on these philosophical subjects were read in the order wherein I
        published them,”</span> are his words in one of his letters to
        Johnson; <span class="tei tei-q">“and a second time with a critical
        eye, adding your own thought and observation upon every part as you
        went along.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first three
        volumes in this edition contain the Philosophical Works exclusively;
        arranged in chronological order, under the three periods of
        Berkeley's life. The First Volume includes those of his early life;
        the Second those produced in middle life; and the Third those of his
        later years. The Miscellaneous Works are presented in like manner in
        the Fourth Volume.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The four little
        treatises in which Berkeley in early life unfolded his new thought
        about the universe, along with his college <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commonplace
        Book</span></span> published in 1871, which prepared the way for
        them, form, along with the Life, the contents of the First Volume. It
        is of them that the author writes thus, in another of his letters to
        Johnson:—<span class="tei tei-q">“I do not indeed wonder that on
        first reading what I have written men are not thoroughly convinced.
        On the contrary, I should very much wonder if prejudices which have
        been many years taking root should be extirpated in a few hours'
        reading. I had no inclination to trouble the world with large
        volumes. What I have done was rather with a view of giving hints to
        thinking men, who have leisure and curiosity to go to the bottom of
        things, and pursue them in their own minds. Two or three times
        reading these small tracts, and making what is read the occasion of
        thinking, would, I believe, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg
        x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> render
        the whole familiar and easy to the mind, and take off that shocking
        appearance which hath often been observed to attend speculative
        truths.”</span> Except Johnson, none of Berkeley's eighteenth-century
        critics seem to have observed this rule.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alciphron, or The
        Minute Philosopher</span></span>, with its supplement in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theory of
        Visual Language Vindicated</span></span>, being the philosophical
        works of his middle life, associated with its American enterprise,
        form the Second Volume. In them the conception of the universe that
        was unfolded in the early writings is applied, in vindication of
        religious morality and Christianity, against the Atheism attributed
        to those who called themselves Free-thinkers; who were treated by
        Berkeley as, at least by implication, atheistic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Third Volume
        contains the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Analyst</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Siris</span></span>,
        which belong to his later life, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Siris</span></span> being especially
        characteristic of its serene quiet. In both there is a deepened sense
        of the mystery of the universe, and in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Siris</span></span>
        especially a more comprehensive conception of the final problem
        suggested by human life. But the metaphysics of the one is lost in
        mathematical controversy; that of the other in medical controversy,
        and in undigested ancient and mediæval learning. The metaphysical
        importance of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Siris</span></span> was long unrecognised,
        although in it Berkeley's thought culminates, not in a paradox about
        Matter, but in the conception of God as the concatenating principle
        of the universe; yet this reached through the conception of Matter as
        real only in and through living Mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Miscellaneous
        Works, after the two juvenile Latin tracts in mathematics, deal with
        observations of nature and man gathered in his travels, questions
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id=
        "Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of social economy, and lessons in
        religious life. Several are posthumous, and were first published in
        the 1871 edition. Of these, perhaps the most interesting is the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal in
        Italy</span></span>. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Discourse on Passive Obedience</span></span> is
        the nearest approach to ethical theory which Berkeley has given to
        us, and as such it might have taken its place in the First Volume;
        but on the whole it seemed more appropriately placed in the Fourth,
        where it is easily accessible for those who prefer to read it
        immediately after the book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have introduced,
        in an Appendix to the Third Volume, some matter of philosophical
        interest for which there was no place in the editorial Prefaces or in
        the annotations. The historical significance of Samuel Johnson and
        Jonathan Edwards, as pioneers of American philosophy, and also
        advocates of the new conception of the material world that is
        associated with Berkeley, is recognised in Appendix C. Illustrations
        of the misinterpretation of Berkeley by his early critics are
        presented in Appendix D. A lately discovered tractate by Berkeley
        forms Appendix E. In the Fourth Volume, numerous queries contained in
        the first edition of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Querist</span></span>, and omitted in the later
        editions, are given in an Appendix, which enables the reader to
        reconstruct that interesting tract in the form in which it originally
        appeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The present
        edition is thus really a new work, which possesses, I hope, a certain
        philosophical unity, as well as pervading biographical interest.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">
          <hr style="width: 50%" />
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Berkeley is the
        immediate successor of Locke, and as he was educated by collision
        with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Essay</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">on Human
        Understanding</span></span>, perhaps Locke ought to have had more
        prominence in the editorial portion of this book. Limitation of space
        partly accounts for the omission; and I venture instead to refer the
        reader to the Prolegomena and notes in my edition of Locke's
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>, which was published by the
        Clarendon Press in 1894. I may add that an expansion of thoughts
        which run through the Life and many of the annotations, in this
        edition of Berkeley, may be found in my <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophy of
        Theism</span></span><a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader need
        not come to Berkeley in the expectation of finding in his Works an
        all-comprehensive speculative system like Spinoza's, or a reasoned
        articulation of the universe of reality such as Hegel is supposed to
        offer. But no one in the succession of great English philosophers
        has, I think, proposed in a way more apt to invite reflexion, the
        final alternative between Unreason, on the one hand, and Moral Reason
        expressed in Universal Divine Providence, on the other hand, as the
        root of the unbeginning and endless evolution in which we find
        ourselves involved; as well as the further question, Whether this
        tremendous practical alternative <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> be
        settled by any means that are within the reach of man? His
        Philosophical Works, taken collectively, may encourage those who see
        in a reasonable <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">via media</span></span> between
        Omniscience and Nescience the true path of progress, under man's
        inevitable venture of reasonable Faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One is therefore
        not without hope that a fresh <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id="Pgxiii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> impulse may be given to philosophy and
        religious thought by this reappearance of George Berkeley, under the
        auspices of the University of Oxford, at the beginning of the
        twentieth century. His readers will at any rate find themselves in
        the company of one of the most attractive personalities of English
        philosophy, who is also among the foremost of those thinkers who are
        masters in English literature—Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, George
        Berkeley and David Hume.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards the end
          of the reign of Charles the Second a certain William Berkeley,
          according to credible tradition, occupied a cottage attached to the
          ancient Castle of Dysert, in that part of the county of Kilkenny
          which is watered by the Nore. Little is known about this William
          Berkeley except that he was Irish by birth and English by descent.
          It is said that his father went over to Ireland soon after the
          Restoration, in the suite of his reputed kinsman, Lord Berkeley of
          Stratton, when he was Lord Lieutenant. William Berkeley's wife
          seems to have been of Irish blood, and in some remote way related
          to the family of Wolfe, the hero of Quebec. It was in the modest
          abode in the valley of the Nore that George, the eldest of their
          six sons, was born, on March 12, 1685.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is nothing
          in the recorded family history of these Dysert Berkeleys that helps
          to explain the singular personality and career of the eldest son.
          The parents have left no mark, and make no appearance in any extant
          records of the family. They probably made their way to the valley
          of the Nore among families of English connexion who, in the quarter
          of a century preceding the birth of George Berkeley, were finding
          settlements in Ireland. The family, as it appears, was not wealthy,
          but was recognised as of gentle blood. Robert, the fifth son,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiv">[pg xxiv]</span><a name=
          "Pgxxiv" id="Pgxxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> became rector of
          Middleton and vicar-general of Cloyne; and another son, William,
          held a commission in the army. According to the Register of Trinity
          College, one of the sons was born <span class="tei tei-q">“near
          Thurles,”</span> in 1699, and Thomas, the youngest, was born in
          Tipperary, in 1703, so that the family may have removed from Dysert
          after the birth of George. In what can be gleaned of the younger
          sons, one finds little appearance of sympathy with the religious
          and philosophical genius of the eldest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding this
          famous eldest son in those early days, we have this significant
          autobiographical fragment in his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commonplace
          Book</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“I was distrustful at
          eight years old, and consequently by nature disposed for the new
          doctrines.”</span> In his twelfth year we find the boy in Kilkenny
          School. The register records his entrance there in the summer of
          1696, when he was placed at once in the second class, which seems
          to imply precocity, for it is almost a solitary instance. He spent
          the four following years in Kilkenny. The School was in high repute
          for learned masters and famous pupils; among former pupils were the
          poet Congreve and Swift, nearly twenty years earlier than George
          Berkeley; among his school-fellows was Thomas Prior, his life-long
          friend and correspondent. In the days of Berkeley and Prior the
          head master was Dr. Hinton, and the School was still suffering from
          the consequences of <span class="tei tei-q">“the warre in
          Ireland”</span> which followed the Revolution.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley in
          Kilkenny School is hardly visible, and we have no means of
          estimating his mental state when he left it. Tradition says that in
          his school-days he was wont to feed his imagination with airy
          visions and romance, a tradition which perhaps originated long
          after in popular misconceptions of his idealism. Dimly discernible
          at Kilkenny, only a few years later he was a conspicuous figure in
          an island that was then beginning to share in the intellectual
          movement of the modern world, taking <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pagexxv">[pg xxv]</span><a name="Pgxxv" id="Pgxxv" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> his place as a classic in English literature,
          and as the most subtle and ardent of contemporary English-speaking
          thinkers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March, 1700,
          at the age of fifteen, George Berkeley entered Trinity College,
          Dublin. This was his home for more than twenty years. He was at
          first a mystery to the ordinary undergraduate. Some, we are told,
          pronounced him the greatest dunce, others the greatest genius in
          the College. To hasty judges he seemed an idle dreamer; the
          thoughtful admired his subtle intelligence and the beauty of his
          character. In his undergraduate years, a mild and ingenuous youth,
          inexperienced in the ways of men, vivacious, humorous, satirical,
          in unexpected ways inquisitive, often paradoxical, through
          misunderstandings he persisted in his own way, full of simplicity
          and enthusiasm. In 1704 (the year in which Locke died) he passed
          Bachelor of Arts, and became Master in 1707, when he was admitted
          to a Fellowship, <span class="tei tei-q">“the only reward of
          learning which that kingdom had to bestow.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Trinity
          College the youth found himself on the tide of modern thought, for
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“new philosophy”</span> of Newton and
          Locke was then invading the University. Locke's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>,
          published in 1690, was already in vogue. This early recognition of
          Locke in Dublin was chiefly due to William Molyneux, Locke's
          devoted friend, a lawyer and member of the Irish Parliament, much
          given to the experimental methods. Descartes, too, with his
          sceptical criticism of human beliefs, yet disposed to spiritualise
          powers commonly attributed to matter, was another accepted
          authority in Trinity College; and Malebranche was not unknown.
          Hobbes was the familiar representative of a finally materialistic
          conception of existence, reproducing in modern forms the atomism of
          Democritus and the ethics of Epicurus. Above all, Newton was
          acknowledged master in physics, whose <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principia</span></span>, issued three
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span><a name=
          "Pgxxvi" id="Pgxxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> years sooner than
          Locke's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>, was transforming the
          conceptions of educated men regarding their surroundings, like the
          still more comprehensive law of physical evolution in the
          nineteenth century.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John Toland, an
          Irishman, one of the earliest and ablest of the new sect of
          Free-thinkers, made his appearance at Dublin in 1696, as the author
          of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span></span>. The
          book was condemned by College dignitaries and dignified clergy with
          even more than Irish fervour. It was the opening of a controversy
          that lasted over half of the eighteenth century in England, in
          which Berkeley soon became prominent; and it was resumed later on,
          with greater intellectual force and in finer literary form, by
          David Hume and Voltaire. The collision with Toland about the time
          of Berkeley's matriculation may have awakened his interest. Toland
          was supposed to teach that matter is eternal, and that motion is
          its essential property, into which all changes presented in the
          outer and inner experience of man may at last be resolved.
          Berkeley's life was a continual protest against these dogmas. The
          Provost of Trinity College in 1700 was Dr. Peter Browne, who had
          already entered the lists against Toland; long after, when Bishop
          of Cork, he was in controversy with Berkeley about the nature of
          man's knowledge of God. The Archbishop of Dublin in the early years
          of the eighteenth century was William King, still remembered as a
          philosophical theologian, whose book on the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Origin of
          Evil</span></span>, published in 1702, was criticised by Boyle and
          Leibniz.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dublin in those
          years was thus a place in which a studious youth, who had been
          <span class="tei tei-q">“distrustful at eight years old,”</span>
          might be disposed to entertain grave questions about the ultimate
          meaning of his visible environment, and of the self-conscious life
          to which he was becoming awake. Is the universe of existence
          confined to the visible world, and is matter the really active
          power in existence? Is God <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pagexxvii">[pg xxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxvii" id="Pgxxvii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the root and centre of all that is real, and
          if so, what is meant by God? Can God be good if the world is a
          mixture of good and evil? Questions like these were ready to meet
          the inquisitive Kilkenny youth in his first years at Dublin.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of his
          earliest interests at College was mathematical. His first
          appearance in print was as the anonymous author of two Latin
          tracts, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Arithmetica</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miscellanea
          Mathematica</span></span>, published in 1707. They are interesting
          as an index of his intellectual inclination when he was hardly
          twenty; for he says they were prepared three years before they were
          given to the world. His disposition to curious questions in
          geometry and algebra is further shewn in his College <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commonplace
          Book</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This lately
          discovered <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Commonplace Book</span></span> throws a flood
          of light upon Berkeley's state of mind between his twentieth and
          twenty-fourth year. It is a wonderful revelation; a record under
          his own hand of his thoughts and feelings when he first came under
          the inspiration of a new conception of the nature and office of the
          material world. It was then struggling to find adequate expression,
          and in it the sanguine youth seemed to find a spiritual panacea for
          the errors and confusions of philosophy. It was able to make short
          work, he believed, with atheistic materialism, and could dispense
          with arguments against sceptics in vindication of the reality of
          experience. The mind-dependent existence of the material world, and
          its true function in the universe of concrete reality, were to be
          disclosed under the light of a new transforming self-evident
          Principle. <span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder not at my sagacity in
          discovering the obvious and amazing truth. I rather wonder at my
          stupid inadvertency in not finding it out before—'tis no witchcraft
          to see.”</span> The pages of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commonplace
          Book</span></span> give vent to rapidly forming thoughts about the
          things of sense and the <span class="tei tei-q">“ambient
          space”</span> of a youth entering into reflective life, in company
          with Descartes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxviii">[pg
          xxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxviii" id="Pgxxviii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> and Malebranche, Bacon and Hobbes, above all,
          Locke and Newton; who was trying to translate into reasonableness
          his faith in the reality of the material world and God. Under the
          influence of this new conception, he sees the world like one
          awakening from a confused dream. The revolution which he wanted to
          inaugurate he foresaw would be resisted. Men like to think and
          speak about things as they have been accustomed to do: they are
          offended when they are asked to exchange this for what appears to
          them absurdity, or at least when the change seems useless. But in
          spite of the ridicule and dislike of a world long accustomed to put
          empty words in place of living thoughts, he resolves to deliver
          himself of his burden, with the politic conciliation of a skilful
          advocate however; for he characteristically reminds himself that
          one who <span class="tei tei-q">“desires to bring another over to
          his own opinions must seem to harmonize with him at first, and
          humour him in his own way of talking.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1709, when he
          was twenty-four years old, Berkeley presented himself to the world
          of empty verbal reasoners as the author of what he calls modestly
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">An Essay
          towards a New Theory of Vision</span></span>. It was dedicated to
          Sir John Percival, his correspondent afterwards for more than
          twenty years; but I have not discovered the origin of their
          friendship. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> was a pioneer, meant to
          open the way for the disclosure of the Secret with which he was
          burdened, lest the world might be shocked by an abrupt disclosure.
          In this prelude he tries to make the reader recognise that in
          ordinary seeing we are always interpreting visual signs; so that we
          have daily presented to our eyes what is virtually an intelligible
          natural language; so that in all our intercourse with the visible
          world we are in intercourse with all-pervading active Intelligence.
          We are reading absent data of touch and of the other senses in the
          language of their visual signs. And the <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="pagexxix">[pg xxix]</span><a name="Pgxxix" id="Pgxxix" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> visual signs themselves, which are the
          immediate objects of sight, are necessarily dependent on sentient
          and percipient mind; whatever may be the case with the tangible
          realities which the visual data signify, a fact evident by our
          experience when we make use of a looking-glass. The material world,
          so far at least as it presents itself visibly, is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
          only in being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">realised</span></em> by living and seeing
          beings. The mind-dependent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">visual</span></em> signs of which we are
          conscious are continually speaking to us of an invisible and
          distant world of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tangible</span></em> realities; and through
          the natural connexion of the visual signs with their tactual
          meanings, we are able in seeing practically to perceive, not only
          what is distant in space, but also to anticipate the future. The
          Book of Vision is in literal truth a Book of Prophecy. The chief
          lesson of the tentative <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay on Vision</span></span> is thus summed
          up:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Upon the whole, I think we may fairly conclude that
          the proper objects of Vision constitute the Universal Language of
          Nature; whereby we are instructed how to regulate our actions in
          order to attain those things that are necessary to the preservation
          and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid whatever may be
          hurtful and destructive of them. And the manner wherein they
          signify and mark out unto us the objects which are at a distance is
          the same with that of languages and signs of human appointment;
          which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness or
          identity of nature, but only by an habitual connexion that
          experience has made us to observe between them. Suppose one who had
          always continued blind be told by his guide that after he has
          advanced so many steps he shall come to the brink of a precipice,
          or be stopped by a wall; must not this to him seem very admirable
          and surprising? He cannot conceive how it is possible for mortals
          to frame such predictions as these, which to him would seem as
          strange and unaccountable as prophecy does to others. Even
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxx">[pg xxx]</span><a name=
          "Pgxxx" id="Pgxxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they who are blessed
          with the visive faculty may (though familiarity make it less
          observed) find therein sufficient cause of admiration. The
          wonderful art and contrivance wherewith it is adjusted to those
          ends and purposes for which it was apparently designed; the vast
          extent, number, and variety of objects that are at once, with so
          much ease and quickness and pleasure, suggested by it—all these
          afford subject for much and pleasing speculation, and may, if
          anything, give us some glimmering analogous prænotion of things
          that are placed beyond the certain discovery and comprehension of
          our present state<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
          "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley took
          orders in the year in which his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span> was published. On February 1, 1709, he was
          ordained as deacon, in the chapel of Trinity College, by Dr. George
          Ashe, Bishop of Clogher. Origen and Augustine, Anselm and Aquinas,
          Malebranche, Fenelon, and Pascal, Cudworth, Butler, Jonathan
          Edwards, and Schleiermacher, along with Berkeley, are among those
          who are illustrious at once in the history of philosophy and of the
          Christian Church. The Church, it has been said, has been for nearly
          two thousand years the great Ethical Society of the world, and if
          under its restrictions it has been less conspicuous on the field of
          philosophical criticism and free inquiry, these names remind us of
          the immense service it has rendered to meditative thought.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The light of the
          Percival correspondence first falls on Berkeley's life in 1709. The
          earliest extant letters from Berkeley to Sir John Percival are in
          September, October, and December of that year, dated at Trinity
          College. In one of them he pronounces Socrates <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the best and most admirable man that the heathen world
          has produced.”</span> Another letter, in March, 1710, accompanies a
          copy of the second edition of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have made some
          alterations and additions in the body of the treatise,”</span> he
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“and in the appendix have endeavoured
          to meet the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxi">[pg
          xxxi]</span><a name="Pgxxxi" id="Pgxxxi" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> objections of the Archbishop of
          Dublin;”</span> whose sermon he proceeds to deprecate, for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“denying that goodness and understanding
          are more to be affirmed of God than feet or hands,”</span> although
          all these may, in a metaphorical sense. How far, or whether at all,
          God is knowable by man, was, as we shall see, matter of discussion
          and controversy with Berkeley in later life; but this shews that
          the subject was already in his thoughts. Returning to the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span>, he tells Sir John that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there remains one objection, that with regard to the
          uselessness of that book of mine; but in a little time I hope to
          make what is there laid down appear subservient to the ends of
          morality and religion, in a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Treatise</span></span> I have in the press,
          the design of which is to demonstrate the existence and attributes
          of God, the immortality of the soul, the reconciliation of God's
          foreknowledge and the freedom of man; and by shewing the emptiness
          and falsehood of several parts of the speculative sciences, to
          induce men to the study of religion and things useful. How far my
          endeavours will prove successful, and whether I have been all this
          time in a dream or no, time will shew. I do not see how it is
          possible to demonstrate the being of a God on the principles of the
          Archbishop—that strictly goodness and understanding can no more be
          assumed of God than that He has feet or hands; there being no
          argument that I know for God's existence which does not prove Him
          at the same time to be an understanding and benevolent being, in
          the strict, literal, and proper meaning of these words.”</span> He
          adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have written to Mr. Clarke to give
          me his thoughts on the subject of God's existence, but have got no
          answer.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work
          foreshadowed in this letter appeared in the summer of 1710, as the

          into</span></span>. In this fragment of a larger work, never
          finished, Berkeley's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxii">[pg
          xxxii]</span><a name="Pgxxxii" id="Pgxxxii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> spiritual conception of matter and cosmos is
          unfolded, defended, and applied. According to the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span>, the world, as far as it is visible, is
          dependent on living mind. According to this book of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> the whole material
          world, as far as it can have any practical concern with the
          knowings and doings of men, is real only by being realised in like
          manner in the percipient experience of some living mind. The
          concrete world, with which alone we have to do, could not exist in
          its concrete reality if there were no living percipient being in
          existence to actualise it. To suppose that it could would be to
          submit to the illusion of a metaphysical abstraction. Matter
          unrealised in its necessary subordination to some one's percipient
          experience is the chief among the illusions which philosophers have
          been too ready to encourage, and which the mass of mankind, who
          accept words without reflecting on their legitimate meanings, are
          ready to accept blindly. But we have only to reflect in order to
          see the absurdity of a material world such as we have experience of
          existing without ever being realised or made concrete in any
          sentient life. Try to conceive an eternally dead universe, empty
          for ever of God and all finite spirits, and you find you cannot.
          Reality can be real only in a living form. Percipient life
          underlies or constitutes all that is real. The <span lang="la"

          which he had been longing to discharge upon mankind for their

          their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          that consequently so long as they are not actually perceived by me,
          or do not exist in my mind, or that of any other created spirit,
          they must either have no existence at all, or else subsist in the
          mind of some Eternal Spirit: it being perfectly unintelligible, and
          involving all the absurdity of abstraction, to attribute to any
          single part of them an existence independent of a Spirit<a id=
          "noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This does not
          mean denial of the existence of the world that is daily presented
          to our senses and which includes our own bodies. On the contrary,
          it affirms, as intuitively true, the existence of the only real
          matter which our senses present to us. The only material world of
          which we have any experience consists of the appearances
          (misleadingly called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em> of sense by Berkeley) which
          are continually rising as real objects in a passive procession of
          interpretable signs, through means of which each finite person
          realises his own individual personality; also the existence of
          other finite persons; and the sense-symbolism that is more or less
          interpreted in the natural sciences; all significant of God. So the
          material world of concrete experience is presented to us as
          mind-dependent and in itself powerless: the deepest and truest
          reality must always be spiritual. Yet this mind-dependent material
          world is the occasion of innumerable pleasures and pains to human
          percipients, in so far as they conform to or contradict its
          customary laws, commonly called the laws of nature. So the
          sense-symbolism in which we live is found to play an important part
          in the experience of percipient beings. But it makes us sceptics
          and atheists when, in its name, we put a supposed dead abstract
          matter in room of the Divine Active Reason of which all natural
          order is the continuous providential expression.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly, God
          must exist, because the material world, in order to be a real
          world, needs to be continually <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          and we have all the certainty of sense and sanity that there
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">is</span></em> a (mind-dependent) material
          world, a boundless and endlessly evolving sense-symbolism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the two years
          after the disclosure of his New Principle we see Berkeley chiefly
          through his correspondence with Percival. He was eager to hear the
          voice of criticism; but the critics were slow to speak, and when
          they did speak they misconceived the question, and of course his
          answer to it. <span class="tei tei-q">“If when you receive my
          book,”</span> he writes from Dublin, in July, 1710, to Sir John,
          who was then in London, <span class="tei tei-q">“you can procure me
          the opinion of some of your acquaintances who are thinking men,
          addicted to the study of natural philosophy and mathematics, I
          shall be extremely obliged to you.”</span> He also asks Percival to
          present the book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> to Lord Pembroke, to
          whom he had ventured to dedicate it, as Locke had done his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>. The reply was
          discouraging.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I did but name the subject-matter of your book of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> to some ingenuous
          friends of mine,”</span> Percival says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and they immediately treated it with ridicule, at the
          same time refusing to read it; which I have not yet got one to do.
          A physician of my acquaintance undertook to describe your person,
          and argued you must needs be mad, and that you ought to take
          remedies. A bishop pitied you, that a desire and vanity of starting
          something new should put you upon such an undertaking; and when I
          justified you in that part of your character, and added other
          deserving qualities you have, he could not tell what to think of
          you. Another told me an ingenious man ought not to be discouraged
          from exerting his wit, and said Erasmus was not worse thought of
          for writing in praise of folly; but that you are not gone as far as
          a gentleman in town, who asserts not only that there is no such
          thing as Matter, but that we ourselves have no being at
          all.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxv">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          surprising that a book which was supposed to deny the existence of
          all that we see and touch should be ridiculed, and its author
          called a madman. What vexed the author was, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that men who had never considered my book should
          confound me with the sceptics, who doubt the existence of sensible
          things, and are not positive of any one thing, not even of their
          own being. But whoever reads my book with attention will see that I
          question not the existence of anything we perceive by our senses.
          Fine spun metaphysics are what on all occasions I declaim against,
          and if any one shall shew anything of that sort in my <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Treatise</span></span> I will willingly
          correct it.”</span> A material world that was real enough to yield
          physical science, to make known to us the existence of other
          persons and of God, and which signified in very practical ways
          happiness or misery to sentient beings, seemed to him sufficiently
          real for human science and all other purposes. Nevertheless, in the
          ardour of youth Berkeley had hardly fathomed the depths into which
          his New Principle led, and which he hoped to escape by avoiding the
          abstractions of <span class="tei tei-q">“fine-spun
          metaphysics.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In December
          Percival writes from London that he has <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“given the book to Lord Pembroke,”</span> who
          <span class="tei tei-q">“thought the author an ingenious man, and
          to be encouraged”</span>; but for himself he <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cannot believe in the non-existence of Matter”</span>;
          and he had tried in vain to induce Samuel Clarke, the great English
          metaphysician, either to refute or to accept the New Principle. In
          February Berkeley sends an explanatory letter for Lord Pembroke to
          Percival's care. In a letter in June he turns to social questions,
          and suggests that if <span class="tei tei-q">“some Irish gentlemen
          of good fortune and generous inclinations would constantly reside
          in England, there to watch for the interests of Ireland, they might
          bring far greater advantage than they could by spending their
          incomes at home.”</span> And so 1711 passes, with responses of
          ignorant critics; vain endeavours to draw <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="pagexxxvi">[pg xxxvi]</span><a name="Pgxxxvi" id="Pgxxxvi"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> worthy criticism from Samuel Clarke;
          the author all the while doing work as a Tutor in Trinity College
          on a modest income; now and then on holidays in Meath or elsewhere
          in Ireland. Three discourses on <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Passive
          Obedience</span></span> in the College Chapel in 1712,
          misinterpreted, brought on him the reproach of Jacobitism. Yet they
          were designed to shew that society rests on a deeper foundation
          than force and calculations of utility, and is at last rooted in
          principles of an immutable morality. Locke's favourite opinion,
          that morality is a demonstrable, seems to weigh with him in these
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Discourses</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Berkeley was
          not yet done with the exposition and vindication of his new
          thought, for it seemed to him charged with supreme practical issues
          for mankind. In the two years which followed the publication of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> he was preparing to
          reproduce his spiritual conception of the universe, in the dramatic
          form of dialogue, convenient for dealing popularly with plausible
          objections. The issue was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Three Dialogues between Hylas and
          Philonous</span></span>, in which Philonous argues for the
          absurdity of an abstract matter that is unrealised in the
          experience of living beings, as against Hylas, who is put forward
          to justify belief in this abstract reality. The design of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span> is to present in a
          familiar form <span class="tei tei-q">“such principles as, by an
          easy solution of the perplexities of philosophers, together with
          their own native evidence, may at once recommend themselves as
          genuine to the mind, and rescue philosophy from the endless
          pursuits it is engaged in; which, with a plain demonstration of the
          Immediate Providence of an all-seeing God, should seem the readiest
          preparation, as well as the strongest motive to the study and
          practice of virtue<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span> were completed, at the
          end of 1712, Berkeley resolved to visit London, as he told
          Percival, <span class="tei tei-q">“in order to print my new book of
          Dialogues, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxvii">[pg

          <span class="tei tei-q">“for the recovery of his health,”</span>
          which had suffered from study, and perhaps too he remembered that
          Bacon commends travel as <span class="tei tei-q">“to the younger
          sort a part of education.”</span></p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley made
          his appearance in London in January, 1713. On the 26th of that
          month he writes to Percival that he <span class="tei tei-q">“had
          crossed the Channel from Dublin a few days before,”</span>
          describes adventures on the road, and enlarges on the beauty of
          rural England, which he liked more than anything he had seen in
          London. <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Clarke”</span> had already
          introduced him to Lord Pembroke. He had also called on his
          countryman Richard Steele, <span class="tei tei-q">“who desired to
          be acquainted with him. Somebody had given him my <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Treatise on the
          Principles of Human Knowledge</span></span>, and that was the
          ground of his inclination to my acquaintance.”</span> He
          anticipates <span class="tei tei-q">“much satisfaction in the
          conversation of Steele and his friends,”</span> adding that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“there is lately published a bold and
          pernicious book, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          In February he <span class="tei tei-q">“dines often with Steele in
          his house in Bloomsbury Square,”</span> and tells in March
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that you will soon hear of Mr. Steele
          under the character of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          shall come out every day as the <span class=

          "font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span>.”</span> The night
          before <span class="tei tei-q">“a very ingenious new poem upon
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Windsor Forest’</span> had been given to
          him by the author, Mr. Pope. The gentleman is a Papist, but a man
          of excellent wit and learning, one of those Mr. Steele mentions in
          his last paper as having writ some of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span>.”</span> A few days
          later he has met <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Addison, who has the
          same talents as Steele in a high degree, and is likewise a great
          philosopher, having applied himself to the speculative studies more
          than any of the wits I know. I breakfasted with him at Dr. Swift's
          lodgings. His coming in while I was there, and the good
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxviii">[pg
          xxxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxxviii" id="Pgxxxviii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> temper he showed, was construed by me as a
          sign of the approaching coalition of parties. A play of Mr.
          Steele's, which was expected, he has now put off till next winter.
          But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cato</span></span>, a most noble play of Mr.
          Addison, is to be acted in Easter week.”</span> Accordingly, on
          April 18, he writes that <span class="tei tei-q">“on Tuesday last
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cato</span></span> was acted for the first
          time. I was present with Mr. Addison and two or three more friends
          in a side box, where we had a talk and two or three flasks of
          Burgundy and Champagne, which the author (who is a very sober man)
          thought necessary to support his spirits, and indeed it was a
          pleasant refreshment to us all between the Acts. Some parts of the
          prologue, written by Mr. Pope, a Tory and even a Papist, were
          hissed, being thought to savour of Whiggism; but the clap got much
          the better of the hiss. Lord Harley, who sat in the next box to us,
          was observed to clap as loud as any in the house all the time of
          the play.”</span> Swift and Pope have described this famous first
          night of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cato</span></span>; now for the first time we
          have Berkeley's report. He adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“This day
          I dined at Dr. Arbuthnot's lodging in the Queen's
          Palace.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His countryman,
          Swift, was among the first to welcome him to London, where Swift
          had himself been for four years, <span class="tei tei-q">“lodging
          in Bury Street,”</span> and sending the daily journal to Stella,
          which records so many incidents of that memorable London life. Mrs.
          Vanhomrigh and her daughter, the unhappy Vanessa, were living in
          rooms in the same street as Swift, and there he <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“loitered, hot and lazy, after his morning's
          work,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“often dined out of mere
          listlessness.”</span> Berkeley was a frequent visitor at Swift's
          house, and this Vanhomrigh connexion with Swift had an influence on
          Berkeley's fortune long afterwards. On a Sunday in April we find
          him at Kensington, at the Court of Queen Anne, in the company of
          Swift. <span class="tei tei-q">“I went to Court to-day,”</span>
          Swift's journal records, <span class="tei tei-q">“on purpose to
          present Mr. Berkeley, one of the Fellows of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxix">[pg xxxix]</span><a name="Pgxxxix" id=
          "Pgxxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Trinity. College, to Lord
          Berkeley of Stratton. That Mr. Berkeley is a very ingenious man,
          and a great philosopher, and I have mentioned him to all the
          ministers, and have given them some of his writings, and I will
          favour him as much as I can.”</span> In this, Swift was as good as
          his word. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dr. Swift,”</span> he adds,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“is admired both by Steele and Addison, and
          I think Addison one of the best natured and most agreeable men in
          the world.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day about
          this time, at the instance of Addison, it seems that a meeting was
          arranged between Berkeley and Samuel Clarke, the metaphysical
          rector of St. James's in Piccadilly, whose opinion he had in vain
          tried to draw forth two years before through Sir John Percival.
          Berkeley's personal charm was felt wherever he went, and even
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the fastidious and turbulent
          Atterbury,”</span> after intercourse with him, is reported to have
          said: <span class="tei tei-q">“So much understanding, so much
          knowledge, so much innocence, and such humility, I did not think
          had been the portion of any but angels till I saw this
          gentleman.”</span> Much was expected from the meeting with Clarke,
          but Berkeley had again to complain that although Clarke had neither
          refuted his arguments nor disproved his premisses, he had not the
          candour to accept his conclusion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was thus that
          Berkeley became known to <span class="tei tei-q">“men of
          merit”</span> in that brilliant society. He was also brought among
          persons on whom he would hardly have conferred this title. He tells
          Percival that he had attended several free-thinking clubs, in the
          pretended character of a learner, and that he there heard Anthony
          Collins, author of <span class="tei tei-q">“the bold and pernicious
          book on free-thinking,”</span> boast <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          he was able to demonstrate that the existence of God is an
          impossible supposition.”</span> The promised <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“demonstration”</span> seems to have been Collins'
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inquiry
          Concerning Human Liberty</span></span>, which appeared two years
          later, according to which all that happens in mind and matter is
          the issue of natural necessity. Steele invited Berkeley to
          contribute <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexl">[pg

          existence between March and September, 1713. He took the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          subject of his first essay. Three other essays are concerned with
          man's hope of a future life, and are among the few passages in his
          writings in which his philosophy is a meditation upon Death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In May, Percival
          writes to him from Dublin that he hears the <span class=

          published, and that your opinion has gained ground among the

          at first seemed shocking is become so familiar that others envy you
          the discovery, and make it their own.”</span> In his reply in June,
          Berkeley mentions that <span class="tei tei-q">“a clergyman in

          something published three years ago in my <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Three
          Dialogues</span></span> were published in June. In the middle of
          that same month he was in Oxford, <span class="tei tei-q">“a most
          delightful place,”</span> where he spent two months, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“witnessed the Act and grand performances at the
          theatre, and a great concourse from London and the country, amongst
          whom were several foreigners.”</span> The Drury Lane Company had
          gone down to Oxford, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cato</span></span> was on the stage for
          several nights. The Percival correspondence now first discloses
          this prolonged visit to Oxford in the summer of 1713, that ideal
          home from whence, forty years after, he departed on a more
          mysterious journey than any on this planet. In a letter from thence
          to Percival, he had claimed Arbuthnot as one of the converts to the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“new Principle.”</span> Percival replied
          that Swift demurred to this, on which Berkeley rejoins:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“As to what you say of Dr. Arbuthnot not
          being of my opinion, it is true there <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          concerning some notions relating to the necessity of the laws of
          nature; but this does not touch the main points of the
          non-existence of what philosophers call material substance; against
          which he acknowledges he can assert nothing.”</span> One would
          gladly have got more than this from Berkeley, about what touched
          his favourite conception of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“arbitrariness”</span> of law in nature, as
          distinguished from the <span class="tei tei-q">“necessity”</span>
          which some modern physicists are ready vaguely to take for
          granted.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scene now
          changes. On October 15 Berkeley suddenly writes from London:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am on the eve of going to Sicily, as
          chaplain to Lord Peterborough, who is Ambassador Extraordinary on
          the coronation of the new king.”</span> He had been recommended by
          Swift to the Ambassador, one of the most extraordinary characters
          then in Europe, who a few years before had astonished the world in
          the war of the Succession in Spain, and afterwards by his genius as
          a diplomatist: in Holland, nearly a quarter of a century before, he
          had formed an intimate friendship with John Locke. Ten months in
          France and Italy in the suite of Lord Peterborough brought the
          young Irish metaphysician, who had lately been introduced to the
          wits of London and the dons of Oxford, into a new world. It was to
          him the beginning of a career of wandering and social activity,
          which lasted, with little interruption, for nearly twenty years,
          during which metaphysics and authorship were in the background. On
          November 25 we find him in Paris, writing letters to Percival and
          Prior. <span class="tei tei-q">“From London to Calais”</span>, he
          tells Prior, <span class="tei tei-q">“I came in company of a
          Flamand, a Spaniard, a Frenchman, and three English servants of my
          Lord. The three gentlemen, being of three different nations,
          obliged me to speak the French language (which is now familiar),
          and gave me the opportunity of seeing much of the world in little
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlii">[pg xlii]</span><a name=
          "Pgxlii" id="Pgxlii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> compass.... On
          November 1 (O.S.) I embarked in the stage-coach, with a company
          that were all perfect strangers to me. There were two Scotch, and
          one English gentleman. One of the former happened to be the author
          of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Voyage to St. Kilda</span></span> and the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Account
          of the Western Isles</span></span><a id="noteref_7" name=
          "noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>. We
          were good company on the road; and that day se'ennight came to
          Paris. I have since been taken up in viewing churches, convents,
          palaces, colleges, &amp;c., which are very numerous and magnificent
          in this town. The splendour and riches of these things surpasses
          belief; but it were endless to descend to particulars. I was
          present at a disputation in the Sorbonne, which indeed had much of
          the French fire in it. I saw the Irish and the English Colleges. In
          the latter I saw, enclosed in a coffin, the body of the late King
          James.... To-morrow I intend to visit Father Malebranche, and
          discourse him on certain points.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Abbé
          D'Aubigné, as he informs Percival, was to introduce him to
          Malebranche, then the chief philosopher of France, whose Vision of
          the world in God had some affinity with Berkeley's own thought.
          Unfortunately we have no record of the intended interview with the
          French idealist, who fourteen years before had been visited by
          Addison, also on his way to Italy, when Malebranche expressed great
          regard for the English nation, and admiration for Newton; but he
          shook his head when Hobbes was mentioned, whom he ventured to
          disparage as a <span class="tei tei-q">“poor silly
          creature.”</span> Malebranche died nearly two years after
          Berkeley's proposed interview; and according to a story
          countenanced by Dugald Stewart, Berkeley was the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“occasional cause”</span> of his death. He found the
          venerable Father, we are told, in a cell, cooking, in a pipkin, a
          medicine for a disorder with which he was troubled. The
          conversation naturally turned on Berkeley's system, of which
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexliii">[pg xliii]</span><a name=
          "Pgxliii" id="Pgxliii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Malebranche had
          received some knowledge from a translation. The issue of the debate
          proved tragical to poor Malebranche. In the heat of disputation he
          raised his voice so high, and gave way so freely to the natural
          impetuosity of a man of genius and a Frenchman, that he brought on
          a violent increase of his disorder, which carried him off a few
          days after<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=
          "#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>. This
          romantic tale is, I suspect, mythical. The Percival correspondence
          shews that Berkeley was living in London in October, 1715, the
          month in which Malebranche died, and I find no trace of a short
          sudden visit to Paris at that time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a month
          spent in Paris, another fortnight carried Berkeley and two
          travelling companions to Italy through Savoy. They crossed Mont
          Cenis on New Year's Day in 1714—<span class="tei tei-q">“one of the
          most difficult and formidable parts of the Alps which is ever
          passed over by mortal man,”</span> as he tells Prior in a letter
          from Turin. <span class="tei tei-q">“We were carried in open chairs
          by men used to scale these rocks and precipices, which at this
          season are more slippery and dangerous than at other times, and at
          the best are high, craggy, and steep enough to cause the heart of
          the most valiant man to melt within him.”</span> At the end of
          other six weeks we find him at Leghorn, where he spent three
          months, <span class="tei tei-q">“while my lord was in
          Sicily.”</span> He <span class="tei tei-q">“prefers England or
          Ireland to Italy: the only advantage is in point of air.”</span>
          From Leghorn he writes in May a complimentary letter to Pope, on
          the occasion of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Rape of the Lock</span></span>: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Style, painting, judgment, spirit, I had already
          admired in your other writings; but in this I am charmed with the
          magic of your invention, with all those images, allusions, and
          inexplicable beauties which you raise so surprisingly, and at the
          same time so naturally, out of a trifle.... I remember to have
          heard you mention some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexliv">[pg
          xliv]</span><a name="Pgxliv" id="Pgxliv" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> half-formed design of coming to Italy. What
          might we not expect from a muse that sings so well in the bleak
          climate of England, if she felt the same warm sun and breathed the
          same air with Virgil and Horace.”</span> In July we find Berkeley
          in Paris on his way back to England. He had <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“parted from Lord Peterborough at Genoa, where my lord
          took post for Turin, and thence designed passing over the Alps, and
          so through Savoy, on his way to England.”</span> In August they are
          in London, where the aspect of English politics was changed by the
          death of the Queen in that month. He seems to have had a fever soon
          after his return. In October, Arbuthnot, in one of his chatty
          letters to Swift, writes thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Poor
          philosopher Berkeley has now the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em> of
          health, which was very hard to produce in him, for he had an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em> of a strange fever upon him,
          so strange that it was very hard to destroy it by introducing a
          contrary one.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our record of
          the two following years is a long blank, first broken by a letter
          to Percival in July, 1715, dated at London. Whether he spent any
          time at Fulham with Lord Peterborough after their return from Italy
          does not appear, nor whether he visited Ireland in those years,
          which is not likely. We have no glimpses of brilliant London
          society as in the preceding year. Steele was now in Parliament.
          Swift had returned to Dublin, and Addison was the Irish chief
          secretary. But Pope was still at Binfield, among the glades of
          Windsor, and Berkeley congratulated him after receiving the first
          volume of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Homer</span></span>. Of his own literary
          pursuits we hear nothing. Perhaps the Second Part of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, which was lost
          afterwards in his travels, engaged him. In the end of July he wrote
          to Lord Percival<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href=
          "#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> from
          Flaxley<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=
          "#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> on the
          Severn; and in August, September, October, and November he wrote
          from London, chiefly interested in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pagexlv">[pg xlv]</span><a name="Pgxlv" id="Pgxlv" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> reports about <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          rebels in Scotland,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the forces
          under Lord Mar, which no doubt will languish and disperse in a
          little time. The Bishop of Bristol assured me the other day that
          the Court expect that the Duke of Orleans would, in case of need,
          supply them with forces against the Pretender.”</span> Our next
          glimpse of him is in May, 1716, when he writes to Lord Percival
          that he is <span class="tei tei-q">“like soon to go to Ireland, the
          Prince of Wales having recommended him to the Lords Justices for
          the living of St. Paul's in Dublin.”</span> This opening was soon
          closed, and the visit to Ireland was abandoned. A groundless
          suspicion of Jacobitism was not overcome by the interest of
          Caroline, Princess of Wales. In June, 1716, Charles Dering wrote
          from Dublin, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lords Justices have
          made a strong representation against him.”</span> He had to look
          elsewhere for the immediate future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find him at
          Turin in November, 1716, with a fresh leave of absence for two
          years from his College. It seems that Ashe, Bishop of Clogher, had
          engaged him as travelling tutor to his son, a means not then
          uncommon for enabling young authors of moderate fortune to see new
          countries and mix with society. Addison had visited Italy in this
          way sixteen years before, and Adam Smith long afterwards travelled
          with the young Duke of Buccleuch. With young Ashe, Berkeley crossed
          Mont Cenis a second time. They reached Rome at the beginning of
          1717. His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Journal in Italy</span></span> in that year,
          and occasional letters to Percival, Pope, and Arbuthnot, shew
          ardent interest in nature and art. With the widest views,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“this very great though singular sort of
          man descended into a minute detail, and begrudged neither pains nor
          expense for the means of information. He travelled through a great
          part of Sicily on foot; clambered over the mountains and crept into
          the caverns, to investigate its natural history and discover the
          causes of its volcanoes; and I have known him sit for hours in
          forges and foundries to inspect their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pagexlvi">[pg xlvi]</span><a name="Pgxlvi" id="Pgxlvi" class=

          If the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Journal</span></span> had been transformed by
          his own hand into a book, his letter to Pope from Inarime shews
          that the book might have rivalled Addison's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Remarks on Parts of
          Italy</span></span> in grace of style and large human interest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the summer of
          1720 we find the travellers at Florence, afterwards for some time
          at Lyons, and in London at the beginning of the next year. On the
          way home his metaphysical inspiration was revived. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cause of Motion”</span> had been proposed by the
          French Academy as the subject of a prize dissertation. The subject
          gave an opportunity for further unfolding his early thought. In the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> and the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span> he had argued for the
          necessary dependence of matter, for its concrete substantial
          reality, upon living percipient mind. He would now shew its
          powerlessness as it is presented to us in sense. The material
          world, chiefly under the category of substance, inspired the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>. The material world,
          under the category of cause or power, inspired the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          Motu</span></span>. This Latin Essay sums up the distinctive
          thought of Berkeley, as it appears in the authorship of his early
          life. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Moles evolvit et agitat
          mentes</span></span> might be taken as the formula of the
          materialism which he sought to dissolve. <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Mens percipit et agitat molem significantem,
          cujus esse est percipi</span></span> expresses what Berkeley would
          substitute for the materialistic formula.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The end of the
          summer of 1721 found Berkeley still in London. England was in the
          social agitation and misery consequent upon the failure of the
          South Sea Company, a gigantic commercial speculation connected with
          British trade in America. A new inspiration took possession of him.
          He thought he saw in this catastrophe signs of a decline in public
          morals worse than that which followed the Restoration. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Political corruption”</span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“decay of religion,”</span> <span class=

          xlvii]</span><a name="Pgxlvii" id="Pgxlvii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> thoughtful. Berkeley's eager imagination was
          apt to exaggerate the evil. He became inspired by social idealism,
          and found vent for his fervour in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">An Essay towards
          preventing the Ruin of Great Britain</span></span>, which, as well
          as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>
          is a significant factor in his career. It was the Cassandra wail of
          a sorrowful and indignant prophet, prepared to shake the dust from
          his feet, and to transfer his eye of hope to other regions, in
          which a nearer approach to Utopia might be realised. The true
          personality of the individual is unrealisable in selfish isolation.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In October,
          1721, Berkeley was in Dublin. The register of the College shews
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“on November 14, 1721, Mr. Berkeley
          had the grace of the House for the Degree of Bachelor and Doctor of
          Divinity.”</span> There is no ground for the report that he
          returned to Ireland at this time as Chaplain to the Duke of
          Grafton, the Lord Lieutenant<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12"
          href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>. But
          preferment in the Church seemed within his reach. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I had no sooner set foot on shore,”</span> he wrote to
          Percival in that October, <span class="tei tei-q">“than I heard
          that the Deanery of Dromore was vacant.”</span> Percival used his
          influence with the Lord Lieutenant, and in February, 1722,
          Berkeley's patent was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlviii">[pg
          xlviii]</span><a name="Pgxlviii" id="Pgxlviii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“passing the Seals
          for the Deanery of Dromore.”</span> But the Bishop of Dromore
          claimed the patronage, and this led to a protracted and ineffectual
          lawsuit, which took Berkeley to London in the following winter,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to see friends and inform himself of
          points of law,”</span> and he tells that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“on the way he was nearly drowned in crossing to
          Holyhead<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=
          "#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's
          interest in church preferment was not personal. He saw in it only
          means to an end. In March, 1723, he surprised Lord Percival by
          announcing, in a letter from London, a project which it seems for
          some time had occupied his thoughts. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
          now about ten months,”</span> he says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“since I have determined to spend the residue of my
          days in Bermuda, where I trust in Providence I may be the mean
          instrument of doing great good to mankind. Whatever happens, go I
          am resolved, if I live. Half a dozen of the most ingenious and
          agreeable men in our College are with me in this project, and since
          I came hither I have got together about a dozen Englishmen of
          quality, who intend to retire to those islands.”</span> He then
          explains the project, opening a vision of Christian civilisation
          radiating from those fair islands of the West, whose idyllic bliss
          poets had sung, diffused over the New World, with its magnificent
          possibilities in the future history of mankind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I find no
          further record of the origin of this bright vision. As it had
          become a practical determination <span class="tei tei-q">“ten
          months”</span> before March, 1723, one is carried back to the first
          months after his return to Dublin and to the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>
          that was called forth by the South Sea catastrophe. One may
          conjecture that despair of England and the Old World—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“such as Europe breeds in her decay”</span>—led him to
          look westward for the hopeful future of mankind, moved, perhaps, by
          the connexion of the catastrophe with America. His active
          imagination pictured a better Republic than Plato's, and a grander
          Utopia than More's, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlix">[pg
          xlix]</span><a name="Pgxlix" id="Pgxlix" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> emanating from a College in the isles of
          which Waller had sung.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime
          a curious fortune unexpectedly favoured him. Swift's unhappy
          Vanessa, associated with Bury Street in 1713, had settled on her
          property at Marley Abbey near Dublin; and Swift had privately
          married Stella, as she confessed to Vanessa, who thereafter revoked
          the bequest of her fortune to Swift, and left it to be divided
          between Berkeley and Marshal, afterwards an Irish judge. Vanessa
          died in May, 1723. A few days after Berkeley wrote thus to Lord
          Percival: <span class="tei tei-q">“Here is something that will
          surprise your lordship as it doth me. Mrs. Hester Vanhomrigh, a
          lady to whom I was a perfect stranger, having never in the whole
          course of my life exchanged a word with her, died on Sunday.
          Yesterday her Will was opened, by which it appears that I am
          constituted executor, the advantage whereof is computed by those
          who understand her affairs to be worth £3000.... My Bermuda scheme
          is now stronger in my mind than ever; this providential event
          having made many things easy which were otherwise before.”</span>
          Lord Percival in reply concludes that he would <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“persist more than ever in that noble scheme, which may
          in some time exalt your name beyond that of St. Xavier and the most
          famous missionaries abroad.”</span> But he warns him that,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“without the protection of
          Government,”</span> he would encounter insurmountable difficulties.
          The Vanessa legacy, and the obstructions in the way of the Deanery
          of Dromore, were the subjects of a tedious correspondence with his
          friend and business factotum, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tom
          Prior,”</span> in 1724 and the three following years. In the end,
          the debts of Vanessa absorbed most of the legacy. And as to the
          Deanery of Dromore, he tells Percival, on September 19, 1723:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I despair of seeing it end to my
          advantage. The truth is, my fixed purpose of going to Bermuda sets
          me above soliciting anything with earnestness in this part
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagel">[pg l]</span><a name="Pgl" id=
          "Pgl" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the world. It can be of no use
          to me, but as it may enable me the better to prosecute that design;
          and it must be owned that the present possession of something in
          the Church would make my application for an establishment in those
          islands more considered.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless, he
          got a Deanery at last. In May, 1724, he informs Lord Percival from
          Trinity College: <span class="tei tei-q">“Yesterday I received my
          patent for the best Deanery in the kingdom, that of Derry. It is
          said to be worth £1500 per annum. But as I do not consider it with
          an eye to enriching myself, so I shall be perfectly contented if it
          facilitates and recommends my scheme of Bermuda, which I am in
          hopes will meet with a better reception if it comes from one
          possessed of so great a Deanery.”</span> In September he is on his
          way, not to Derry, but to London, <span class="tei tei-q">“to raise
          funds and obtain a Charter for the Bermuda College from George the
          First,”</span> fortified by a remarkable letter from Swift to Lord
          Carteret, the new Lord Lieutenant, who was then in Bath<a id=
          "noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>. As
          Swift predicted in this letter, Berkeley's conquests spread far and
          fast in England, where he organised his resources during the four
          following years. Nothing shews more signally the magic of his
          personality than the story of his life in London in those years of
          negotiation and endeavour. The proposal met with a response
          wonderful in a generation represented by Walpole. The subscriptions
          soon reached five thousand pounds, and Walpole was among the
          subscribers. The Scriblerus Club, meeting at Lord Bathurst's,
          agreed to rally Berkeley, who was among them, on his Bermuda
          scheme. He asked to be heard in defence, and presented the case
          with such force of enthusiasm that the company <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“were struck dumb, and after a pause simultaneously
          rose and asked leave to accompany him.”</span> Bermuda for a time
          inspired London.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageli">[pg
          li]</span><a name="Pgli" id="Pgli" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley was not
          satisfied with this. He remembered what Lord Percival had said
          about failure without help from Government. Accordingly he obtained
          a Charter from George the First early in 1726, and after canvassing
          the House of Commons, secured a grant of £20,000, with only two
          dissentient votes, in May of that year. This was the beginning of
          his difficulties. Payment was indefinitely delayed, and he was kept
          negotiating; besides, with the help of Prior, he was unravelling
          legal perplexities in which the Vanessa legacy was involved. It was
          in these years that he was seen at the receptions of Caroline at
          Leicester Fields, when she was Princess of Wales, and afterwards at
          St. James's or at Kensington, when she became Queen in 1727; not,
          he says, because he loved Courts, but because he loved America.
          Clarke was still rector of St. James's, and Butler had not yet
          migrated to his parsonage at Stanhope; so their society was open to
          him. The Queen liked to listen to a philosophical discussion. Ten
          years before, as Princess of Wales, she had been a royal go-between
          in the famous correspondence between Clarke and Leibniz. And now,
          Berkeley being in London, he too was asked to her weekly reunions,
          when she loved to hear Clarke arguing with Berkeley, or Berkeley
          arguing with Hoadley. Also in 1726 Voltaire made his lengthened
          visit to England, a familiar figure in the circle of Pope's
          friends, attracted to the philosophy of Locke and Newton; and
          Voltaire mentions that he met <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          discoverer of the true theory of vision”</span> during his stay in
          London.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the summer
          of 1727 until the spring of 1728 there is no extant correspondence
          either with Percival or <span class="tei tei-q">“Tom Prior”</span>
          to throw light on his movements. In February, 1728, he was still in
          London, but he <span class="tei tei-q">“hoped to set out for Dublin
          in March, and to America in May.”</span> There is a mystery about
          this visit to Dublin. <span class="tei tei-q">“I propose to set out
          for Dublin about a month hence,”</span> he writes to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“dear <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelii">[pg
          lii]</span><a name="Pglii" id="Pglii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Tom,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“but of this you must not give
          the least intimation to anybody. It is of all things my earnest
          desire (and for very good reasons) not to have it known that I am
          in Dublin. Speak not, therefore, one syllable of it to any mortal
          whatsoever. When I formerly desired you to take a place for me near
          the town, you gave out that you were looking for a retired lodging
          for a friend of yours; upon which everybody surmised me to be the
          person. I must beg you not to act in the like manner now, but to
          take for me an entire house in your own name, and as for yourself;
          for, all things considered, I am determined upon a whole house,
          with no mortal in it but a maid of your own putting, who is to look
          on herself as your servant. Let there be two bed-chambers: one for
          you, another for me; and, as you like, you may ever and anon lie
          there. I would have the house, with necessary furniture, taken by
          the month (or otherwise, as you can), for I propose staying not
          beyond that time; and yet perhaps I may. Take it as soon as
          possible.... Let me entreat you to say nothing of this to anybody,
          but to do the thing directly.... I would of all things ... have a
          proper place in a retired situation, where I may have access to
          fields and sweet air provided against the moment I arrive. I am
          inclined to think one may be better concealed in the outermost
          skirt of the suburbs, than in the country or within the town.... A
          house quite detached in the country I should have no objection to,
          provided you judge that I shall not be liable to discovery in it.
          The place called Bermuda I am utterly against. Dear Tom, do this
          matter cleanly and cleverly, without waiting for further advice....
          To the person from whom you hire it (whom alone I would have you
          speak of it to) it will not seem strange you should at this time of
          the year be desirous, for your own convenience or health, to have a
          place in a free and open air.”</span> This mysterious letter was
          written in April. From April till September Berkeley again
          disappears. There is in all <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pageliii">[pg liii]</span><a name="Pgliii" id="Pgliii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> this a curious secretiveness of which one has
          repeated examples in his life. Whether he went to Dublin in that
          spring, or why he wanted to go, does not appear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in September
          he emerges unexpectedly at Gravesend, newly married, and ready to
          sail for Rhode Island, <span class="tei tei-q">“in a ship of 250
          tons which he had hired.”</span> The marriage, according to Stock,
          took place on August 1, whether in Ireland or in England I cannot
          tell. The lady was Anne, daughter of John Forster, late Chief
          Justice, and then Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. She shared
          his fortune when he was about to engage in the most romantic, and
          ideally the grandest, Christian mission of the eighteenth century.
          According to tradition she was a devoutly religious mystic: Fénelon
          and Madame Guyon were among her favourites. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I chose her,”</span> he tells Lord Percival,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“for her qualities of mind and her
          unaffected inclination to books. She goes with great thankfulness,
          to live a plain farmer's life, and wear stuff of her own spinning.
          I have presented her with a spinning-wheel.”</span> A letter to
          Prior, dated <span class="tei tei-q">“Gravesend September 5,

          they carried stores and goods to a great value, and that the Dean
          <span class="tei tei-q">“embarked 20,000 books, besides what the
          two gentlemen carried. They <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the Dean intends to winter, and to purchase an estate, in order to
          settle a correspondence and trade between that island and
          Bermudas.”</span> Berkeley was in his forty-fourth year, when, full
          of glowing visions of Christian Empire in the West, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Time's noblest offspring,”</span> he left England, on
          his way to Bermuda, with the promise of Sir Robert Walpole that he
          should receive the promised grant after he had made an investment.
          He bought land in America, but he never reached Bermuda.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards the end
          of January, in 1729, the little party, in the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“hired ship of 250 tons,”</span> made their appearance
          in Narragansett Bay, on the western side of Rhode Island.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Blundering about the ocean,”</span> they
          had touched at Virginia on the way, whence a correspondent,
          sceptical of the enterprise, informs Lord Percival that the Dean
          <span class="tei tei-q">“had dined with the Governor, and visited
          our College,”</span> but thinks that <span class="tei tei-q">“when
          the Dean comes to put his visionary scheme into practice, he will
          find it no better than a religious frenzy,”</span> and that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he is as much a Don Quixote in zeal as
          that renowned knight was in chivalry. I wish the good Dean may not
          find out at last that Waller really kidnapt him over to Bermuda,
          and that the project he has been drawn into may not prove in every
          point of it poetical.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have a
          picture of the landing at Newport, on a winter day early in 1729.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Yesterday arrived here Dean Berkeley of
          Londonderry, in a pretty large ship. He is a gentleman of middle
          stature, of an agreeable, pleasant, and erect aspect. He was
          ushered into the town with a great number of gentlemen, to whom he
          behaved himself after a very complaisant manner. 'Tis said he

          Newport was then a flourishing town, nearly a century old, an
          emporium of American commerce, in those days the rival of Boston
          and New York. He was <span class="tei tei-q">“never more

          he says, than <span class="tei tei-q">“at the size of the town and
          harbour.”</span> Around him was some of the softest rural and
          grandest ocean scenery in the world, which had fresh charms even
          for one whose boyhood was spent in the valley of the Nore, who had
          lingered in the Bay of Naples, and wandered in Inarime and among
          the mountains of Sicily. He was seventy miles from Boston, and
          about as far from Newhaven and Yale College. A range of hills
          crosses the centre of the island, whence meadows slope to the rocky
          shore. The Gulf Stream tempers the surrounding sea. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The people,”</span> he tells Percival, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“are industrious; and though less orthodox have not
          less virtue, and I am sure they have more regularity, than those I
          left in Europe. They are indeed a strange medley of different
          persuasions.”</span> The gentry retained the customs of the squires
          in England: tradition tells of a cheerful society: the fox chase,
          with hounds and horses, was a favourite recreation. The society,
          for so remote a region, was well informed. The family libraries and
          pictures which remain argue culture and refinement. Smibert, the
          artist of the missionary party, who had moved to Boston, soon found
          employment in America, and his pictures still adorn houses in Rhode
          Island<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dean and his
          young wife lived in Newport for some months after their arrival.
          Mr. Honeyman, a missionary of the English Society, had been placed
          there, in Trinity Church, in 1704. The church is still a
          conspicuous object from the harbour. Berkeley preached in it three
          days after his arrival, and occasionally afterwards. Notes of his
          sermons are included in this edition among his Miscellaneous
          Works.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the summer of
          1729 he moved from Newport to a quiet valley in the interior of the
          island, where he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelvi">[pg
          lvi]</span><a name="Pglvi" id="Pglvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          bought a farm, and built a house. In this island-home, named
          Whitehall, he lived for more than two years—years of domestic
          happiness, and of resumed study, much interrupted since he left
          Dublin in 1713. The house may still be seen, a little aside from
          the road that runs eastward from Newport, about three miles from
          the town. It is built of wood. The south-west room was probably the
          library. The ocean is seen in the distance, while orchards and
          groves offer the shade and silence which soothed the thinker in his
          recluse life. No invitations of the three companions of his
          voyage<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href=
          "#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>, who
          had migrated to Boston, could allure him from this retreat, where
          he diverted his anxieties about Bermuda by the thoughts which found
          expression in the dialogues of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span>,
          redolent of Rhode Island and the invigorating breezes of its ocean
          shore. Tradition tells that much of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span> was the issue of
          meditation in the open air, at a favourite retreat, beneath the
          Hanging Rocks, which commands an extensive view of the beach and
          the ocean; and the chair in which he sat in this alcove is still
          preserved with veneration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Berkeley
          loved domestic quiet at Whitehall<a id="noteref_21" name=

          the <span class="tei tei-q">“still air of delightful
          studies,”</span> he mixed occasionally in the society of Newport.
          He found it not uncongenial, and soon after he was settled at
          Whitehall he led the way in forming a club, which held occasional
          meetings, the germ of the Redwood Library, still a useful Newport
          institution. His own house was a place of meeting for the New
          England missionaries.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after his
          arrival in Rhode Island, Berkeley was visited by the Reverend
          Samuel Johnson, missionary at Stratford, an acute and independent
          thinker, one of the two contemporary representatives of philosophy
          in America. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelvii">[pg
          lvii]</span><a name="Pglvii" id="Pglvii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> The other was Jonathan Edwards, at that time
          Congregational minister at Northampton on the Connecticut river.
          They had both adopted a conception of the meaning and office of the
          material world in the economy of existence that was in many
          respects similar to Berkeley's<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22"
          href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>. It
          seems that Berkeley's book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> had before this
          fallen into Johnson's hands. He hastened to visit the author when
          he heard of his arrival. A succession of visits and a life-long
          correspondence followed. The <span class="tei tei-q">“non-existence
          of Matter,”</span> interpreted as a whimsical and even insane
          paradox, was found by Johnson to mean the absence of unrealisable
          Substance behind the real material world that is presented to our
          senses, and of unrealisable Power in the successive sense-presented
          appearances of which alone we are percipient. He came to see the
          real existence of the things of sense in the constant order of the
          data of sense, through which we gain our knowledge of the existence
          of our fellow men, and of the omnipresent constant Providence of
          God; whose Ideas are the true archetypes of the visible world. He
          adopted and applied this conception with a lucidity and force which
          give him a high place among American thinkers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the while a
          cloud darkened the recluse life at Whitehall. In June, 1729,
          Berkeley explains to Percival the circumstances and secrecy of his
          departure from England:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Before I left England I was reduced to a difficult
          situation. Had I continued there, the report would have obtained
          (which I had found beginning to spread) that I had dropped the
          design, after it had cost me and my friends so much trouble and
          expense. On the other hand, if I had taken leave of my friends,
          even those who assisted and approved my undertaking would have
          condemned my coming abroad before the King's bounty was
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelviii">[pg lviii]</span><a name=
          "Pglviii" id="Pglviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> received. This
          obliged me to come away in the private manner that I did, and to
          run the risque of a tedious winter voyage. Nothing less would have
          convinced the world that I was in earnest, after the report I knew
          was growing to the contrary.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Months passed,
          and Walpole's promise was still unfulfilled. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I wait here,”</span> he tells Lord Percival in March,
          1730, <span class="tei tei-q">“with all the anxiety that attends
          suspense, until I know what I can depend upon, or what course I am
          to take. On the one hand I have no notion that the Court would put
          what men call a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bite</span></em> upon a poor clergyman, who
          depended upon charters, grants, votes, and the like engagements. On
          the other hand, I see nothing done towards payment of the
          money.”</span> Later on he writes—<span class="tei tei-q">“As for
          the raillery of European wits, I should not mind it, if I saw my
          College go on and prosper; but I must own the disappointments I
          have met with in this particular have nearly touched me, not
          without affecting my health and spirits. If the founding a College
          for the spread of religion and learning in America had been a
          foolish project, it cannot be supposed the Court, the Ministers,
          and the Parliament would have given such public encouragement to
          it; and if, after all that encouragement, they who engaged to endow
          and protect it let it drop, the disappointment indeed may be to me,
          but the censure, I think, will light elsewhere.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The suspense was
          at last ended. Gibson, the Bishop of London, pressed Walpole for a
          final answer. <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> he replied,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“you put this question to me as a Minister,
          I must, and can, assure you that the money shall most undoubtedly
          be paid, as soon as suits with public convenience; but if you ask
          me as a friend, whether Dean Berkeley should continue in America
          expecting the payment of twenty thousand pounds, I advise him by
          all means to return home to Europe, and to give up his present
          expectations.”</span> It was thus that in 1731 the Prime Minister
          of England <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelix">[pg
          lix]</span><a name="Pglix" id="Pglix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          crushed the project conceived ten years before, and to which the
          intervening period had, under his encouragement, been devoted by
          the projector with a singular enthusiasm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few months
          after this heavy blow, Berkeley, with his wife, and Henry their
          infant child, bade farewell to the island home. They sailed from
          Boston in the late autumn of 1731, and in the following February we
          find them in London. Thus ended the romantic episode of Rhode
          Island, with its ideal of Christian civilisation, which so moves
          the heart and touches the imagination in our retrospect of the
          eighteenth century. Of all who have ever landed on the American
          shore, none was ever moved by a purer and more self-sacrificing
          spirit. America still acknowledges that by Berkeley's visit on this
          mission it has been invested with the halo of an illustrious name,
          and associated with religious devotion to a magnificent ideal, even
          if it was sought to be realised by impracticable means. To reform
          the New World, and mankind at last, by a College on an island in
          the Atlantic, six hundred miles from America, the Indians whom it
          was intended to civilise being mostly in the interior of the
          continent, and none in Bermuda, was not unnaturally considered
          Quixotic; and that it was at first supported by the British Court
          and Parliament is a wonderful tribute to the persuasive genius of
          the projector. Perhaps he was too much influenced by Lord
          Percival's idea, that it could not be realised by private
          benevolence, without the intervention of the Crown. But the
          indirect influence of Berkeley's American inspiration is apparent
          in many ways in the intellectual and spiritual life of that great
          continent, during the last century and a half, especially by the
          impulse given to academical education. It is the testimony of an
          American author that, <span class="tei tei-q">“by methods different
          from those intended by Berkeley, and in ways more manifold than
          even he could have dreamed, he has since accomplished, and through
          all coming time, by a thousand ineffaceable <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="pagelx">[pg lx]</span><a name="Pglx" id="Pglx"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> influences, he will continue to
          accomplish, some portion at least of the results which he had aimed
          at in the founding of his university. It is the old story over
          again; the tragedy of a Providence wiser than man's foresight; God
          giving the victory to His faithful servant even through the
          bitterness of overruling him and defeating him<a id="noteref_23"
          name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=

          American Empire, as we now see it with its boundless beneficent
          influence, is at least an imperfect realisation of Berkeley's
          dream.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's head
          quarters were in London, in Green Street, for more than two years
          after the return to England in the beginning of 1732. Extant
          correspondence with Lord Percival ends in Rhode Island, and our
          picture of the two years in London is faintly formed by letters to
          Prior and Johnson. These speak of ill-health, and breathe a less
          sanguine spirit. The brilliant social life of former visits was
          less attractive now, even if old friends had remained. But Swift
          had quitted England for ever, and Steele had followed Addison to
          the grave. Gay, the common friend of Berkeley and Pope, died soon
          after the return from Rhode Island, and Arbuthnot was approaching
          his end at Hampstead. Samuel Clarke had passed away when Berkeley
          was at Whitehall; but Seeker now held the rectory of St. James's,
          and Butler was in studious retirement on the Wear; while Pope was
          at Twickenham, publishing his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay on Man</span></span>, receiving visits
          from Bolingbroke, or visiting Lord Bathurst at Cirencester Park.
          Queen Caroline, too, was holding her receptions at Kensington; but
          <span class="tei tei-q">“those who imagine (as you write),”</span>
          he tells Prior in January, 1734, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I
          have been making my court here all this time, would never believe
          (what is most true) that I have not been at the Court or at the
          Minister's but once these seven years. The care of my health and

          retirement have prevailed over whatsoever ambition might have come
          to my share.”</span> There is a hint of a visit to Oxford, at
          Commemoration in 1733, when his friend Seeker received the honorary
          degree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after he
          had settled in London, the fruit of his studies in Rhode Island was
          given to the world in the Seven Dialogues of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alciphron, or The
          Minute Philosopher</span></span>. Here the philosophical
          inspiration of his early years is directed to sustain faith in
          Divine Moral Order, and in the Christian Revelation. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span> is the longest, and in
          literary form perhaps the most finished of his works, unsurpassed
          in lively strokes of irony and satire. Yet if it is to be regarded
          as a philosophical justification of religion, as against modern
          agnosticism, one may incline to the judgment of Mr. Leslie Stephen,
          that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“the least admirable of all its
          author's admirable works.”</span> As we have seen, the sect of
          free-thinkers was early the object of Berkeley's ridicule and
          sarcasm. They claimed for themselves wide intellectual vision, yet
          they were blind to the deep realities of the universe; they took
          exclusive credit for freedom of thought, although their thinking
          was confined within the narrow compass of our data in sense. The
          book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Motu</span></span>
          of his early years, were designed to bring into clear light the
          absolute dependence of the world that is presented to our senses on
          Omnipresent Spirit; and the necessary subjection of all changes in
          our surroundings to the immediate agency or providence of God.
          Boasted <span class="tei tei-q">“free-thinking”</span> was really a
          narrow atheism, so he believed, in which meaningless Matter usurped
          the place that belonged in reason to God, and he employed reason to
          disclose Omnipotent Intelligence in and behind the phenomena that
          are presented to the senses in impotent natural sequence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The causes of
          the widespread moral corruption of the Old World, which had moved
          Berkeley so profoundly, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxii">[pg
          lxii]</span><a name="Pglxii" id="Pglxii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> seem to have been pondered anew during his
          recluse life in Rhode Island. The decline of morals was explained
          by the deification of Matter: consequent life of sensuous pleasure
          accounted for decay of religion. That vice is hurtful was argued by
          free-thinkers like Mandeville to be a vulgar error, and a
          fallacious demonstration was offered of its utility. That virtue is
          intrinsically beautiful was taught by Shaftesbury; but Berkeley
          judged the abstract beauty, with which <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“minute philosophers”</span> were contented, unfit to
          move ordinary human beings to self-sacrificing action; for this
          involves devotion to a Perfect Person by whom goodness is finally
          distributed. Religion alone inspires the larger and higher life, in
          presenting distributive justice personified on the throne of the
          universe, instead of abstract virtue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          turning-point in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span> is in man's vision of
          God. This is pressed in the Fourth Dialogue. The free-thinker
          asserts that <span class="tei tei-q">“the notion of a Deity, or
          some invisible power, is of all prejudices the most unconquerable;
          the most signal example of belief without reason for
          believing.”</span> He demands proof—<span class="tei tei-q">“such
          proof as every man of sense requires of a matter of fact.... Should
          a man ask, why I believe there is a king of Great Britain? I might
          answer, Because I had seen him. Or a king of Spain? Because I had
          seen those who saw him. But as for this King of kings, I neither
          saw Him myself, nor any one else that ever did see Him.”</span> To
          which Euphranor replies, <span class="tei tei-q">“What if it should
          appear that God really speaks to man; would this content you? What
          if it shall appear plainly that God speaks to men by the
          intervention and use of arbitrary, outward, sensible signs, having
          no resemblance or necessary connexion with the things they stand
          for and suggest; if it shall appear that, by innumerable
          combinations of these signs, an endless variety of things is
          discovered and made known to us; and that we are thereby instructed
          or informed in their different natures; that we are taught
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxiii">[pg lxiii]</span><a name=
          "Pglxiii" id="Pglxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and admonished
          what to shun and what to pursue; and are directed how to regulate
          our motions, and how to act with respect to things distant from us,
          as well in time as place: will this content you?”</span> Euphranor
          accordingly proceeds to shew that Visible Nature is a Language, in
          which the Universal Power that is continually at work is speaking
          to us all, in a way similar to that in which our fellow men speak
          to us; so that we have as much (even more) reason to believe in the
          existence of the Universal Person who is the Speaker, as we have to
          believe in the existence of persons around us; who become known to
          us, when they too employ sense-symbols, in the words and actions by
          which we discover that we are not alone in the universe. For men
          are really living spirits: their <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bodies</span></em>
          are only the sign of their spiritual personality. And it is so with
          God, who is also revealed in the visible world as a Spirit.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“In a strict sense,”</span> says Euphranor,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not see Alciphron, but only such
          visible signs and tokens as suggest and infer the being of that
          invisible thinking principle or soul. Even so, in the self-same
          manner, it seems to me that, though I cannot with eyes of flesh
          behold the invisible God, yet I do, in the strictest sense, behold
          and perceive, by all my senses, such signs and tokens ... as
          suggest, indicate, and demonstrate an invisible God as certainly,
          and with the same evidence, at least, as any other signs, perceived
          by sense, do suggest to me the existence of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your</span></em>
          soul, spirit, or thinking principle; which I am convinced of only
          by a few signs or effects, and the motions of one small organised
          body; whereas I do, at all times, and in all places, perceive
          sensible signs which evince the being of God.”</span> In short, God
          is the living Soul of the Universe; as you and I are the living
          souls that keep our bodies and their organs in significant motion.
          We can interpret the character of God in the history of the
          universe, even as we can interpret the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pagelxiv">[pg lxiv]</span><a name="Pglxiv" id="Pglxiv" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> character of our neighbour by observing his
          words and outward actions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This overwhelmed
          Alciphron. <span class="tei tei-q">“You stare to find that God is
          not far from any one of us, and that in Him we live and move and
          have our being,”</span> rejoins Euphranor. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You who, in the beginning of this conference, thought
          it strange that God should leave Himself without a witness, do now
          think it strange the witness should be so full and clear.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I must own I do,”</span> was the reply.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I never imagined it could be pretended
          that we saw God with our fleshly eyes, as plain as we see any human
          person whatsoever, and that He daily speaks to our senses in a
          manifest and clear dialect.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although this
          reasoning satisfied Alciphron, others may think it inconclusive.
          How one is able to discover the existence of other persons, and
          even the meaning of finite personality, are themselves questions
          full of speculative difficulty. But, waiving this, the analogy
          between the relation of a human spirit to its body, and that of the
          Omnipresent and Omnipotent Spirit to the Universe of things and
          persons, fails in several respects. God is supposed to be
          continually creating the world by constant and continuous
          Providence, and His Omniscience is supposed to comprehend all its
          concrete relations: a man's body is not absolutely dependent on the
          man's own power and providence; and even his scientific knowledge
          of it, in itself and in its relations, is scanty and imperfect, as
          his power over it is limited and conditioned. Then the little that
          a man gradually learns of what is going on in the surrounding
          universe is dependent on his senses: Omniscience comprehends
          Immensity and Eternity (so we suppose) in a single intuition. Our
          bodies, moreover, are visible things: the universe, this organism
          of God, is crowded with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">persons</span></em>, to whom there is nothing
          corresponding within the organism which reveals one man to
          another.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this is not
          all. After Euphranor has found that the Universal Power is
          Universal Spirit, this is still an inadequate <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="pagelxv">[pg lxv]</span><a name="Pglxv" id="Pglxv"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God; for what we want to know is what
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sort</span></em> of Spirit God is. Is God
          omnipotent or of limited power, regarded ethically, fair or unfair
          in His treatment of persons; good or evil, according to the highest
          yet attained conception of goodness; a God of love, or a devil
          omnipotent? I infer the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">character</span></em> of my neighbour from his
          words and actions, patent to sense in the gradual outward evolution
          of his life. I am asked to infer the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">character</span></em> of the Omnipresent
          Spirit from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">His</span></em> words and actions, manifested
          in the universe of things and persons. But we must not attribute to
          the Cause more than it reveals of itself in its effects. God and
          men alike are known by the effects they produce. The Universal
          Power is, on this condition, righteous, fair, and loving to the
          degree in which those conceptions are implied in His visible
          embodiment: to affirm more or other than this, on the basis of
          analogy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">alone</span></em>, is either to indulge in
          baseless conjecture, or to submit blindly to dogma and
          authority.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the
          universe, as far as it comes within the range of human experience
          on this planet, is full of suffering and moral disorder. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“religious hypothesis”</span> of a
          perfectly righteous and benevolent God is here offered to account
          for the appearances which the universe presents to us. But do these
          signify exact distributive justice? Is not visible nature
          apparently cruel and unrelenting? If we infer cruelty in the
          character of a man, because his bodily actions cause undeserved
          suffering, must we not, by this analogy, infer in like manner
          regarding the character of the Supreme Spirit, manifested in the
          progressive evolution of the universal organism?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find it
          impossible to determine with absolute certainty the character even
          of our fellow men, from their imperfectly interpreted words and
          actions, so that each man is more or less a mystery to his fellows.
          The mystery deepens when we try to read the character of
          animals,—to interpret the motives which determine the overt acts
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxvi">[pg lxvi]</span><a name=
          "Pglxvi" id="Pglxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of dogs or horses.
          And if we were able to communicate by visible signs with the
          inhabitants of other planets, with how much greater difficulty
          should we draw conclusions from their visible acts regarding
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">their</span></em> character? But if this is so
          when we use the data of sense for reading the character of finite
          persons, how infinite must be the difficulty of reading the
          character of the Eternal Spirit, in and through the gradual
          evolution of the universe of things and persons, which in this
          reasoning is supposed to be His body; and the history of that
          universe the facts of His biography, in and by which He is
          eternally revealing Himself! For we know nothing about the
          unbeginning and unending. The universe of persons is assumed to
          have no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">end</span></em>; and I know not why its
          evolution must be supposed to have had a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">beginning</span></em>, or that there ever was
          a time in which God was unmanifested, to finite persons.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shall we in
          these circumstances turn with Euphranor, in the Fifth and Sixth
          Dialogues, to professed revelation of the character of the
          Universal Mind presented in miraculous revelation, by inspired
          prophets and apostles, who are brought forward as authorities able
          to speak infallibly to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">character</span></em> of God? If the whole
          course of nature, or endless evolution of events, is the Divine
          Spirit revealed in omnipresent activity, what room is there for any
          other less regular revelation? The universe of common experience,
          it is implied by Berkeley, is essentially miraculous, and therefore
          absolutely perfect. Is it consistent with fairness, and
          benevolence, and love of goodness in all moral agents for its own
          sake, that the Christian revelation should have been so long
          delayed, and be still so incompletely made known? Is not the
          existence of wicked persons on this or any other planet, wicked men
          or devils, a dark spot in the visible life of God? Does not perfect
          goodness in God mean restoration of goodness in men, for its own
          sake, apart from their merit; and must not Omnipotent Goodness,
          infinitely opposite to all evil, either <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="pagelxvii">[pg lxvii]</span><a name="Pglxvii" id="Pglxvii"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> convert to goodness all beings in the
          universe who have made themselves bad, or else relieve the universe
          of their perpetual presence in ever-increasing wickedness?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sceptical
          criticism of this sort has found expression in the searching minute
          philosophy of a later day than Berkeley's and Alciphron's; as in
          David Hume and Voltaire, and in the agnosticism of the nineteenth
          century. Was not Euphranor too ready to yield to the demand for a
          visible God, whose character had accordingly to be determined by
          what appears in nature and man, under the conditions of our limited
          and contingent experience? Do we not need to look below data of
          sensuous experience, and among the presuppositions which must
          consciously or unconsciously be taken for granted in all man's
          dealings with the environment in which he finds himself, for the
          root of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">trustworthy</span></em> experience? On merely
          physical reasoning, like that of Euphranor, the righteous love of
          God is an unwarranted inference, and it even seems to be
          contradicted by visible facts presented in the history of the
          world. But if Omnipotent Goodness must <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> be attributed to the Universal Mind, as an
          indispensable condition for man's having reliable intercourse of
          any sort with nature; if this is the primary postulate necessary to
          the existence of truth of any kind—then the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“religious hypothesis”</span> that God is Good,
          according to the highest conception of goodness, is no groundless
          fancy, but the fundamental faith-venture in which man has to live.
          It <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          can be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">demonstrated</span></em> that the mixture of
          good and evil which the universe presents, necessarily contradicts
          this fundamental presupposition: and if so, man is lost in
          pessimistic Pyrrhonism, and can assert nothing about anything<a id=

          by those who make ridicule the test of truth,”</span> although it

          cannot comprehend his philosophy, and Hoadley shewed a less
          friendly spirit. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          in the year after its appearance. Three other critics, more worthy

          public notice of them. To answer objections already answered, and
          repeat the same things, is a needless as well as disagreeable task.
          Nor should I have taken notice of that Letter about Vision, had it
          not been printed in a newspaper, which gave it course, and spread
          it through the kingdom. Besides, the theory of Vision I found was

          it touched a great question, which periodically has awakened
          controversy, and been the occasion of mutual misunderstanding among
          the controversialists in past ages. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is God
          knowable by man; or must religion be devotion to an object that is
          unknowable?”</span> In one of his first letters to Lord Percival,
          as we saw, Berkeley animadverted on a sermon by the Archbishop of
          Dublin, which seemed to deny that there was goodness, or
          understanding God, any more than feet or hands. An opinion somewhat
          similar had been attributed to Bishop Browne, in his answer to
          Toland, and afterwards in 1728, in his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Procedure and Limits
          of Human Understanding</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This touched to
          the quick Berkeley's ultimate conception of the universe, as
          realisable only in, and therefore necessarily dependent on, living
          mind. We are reminded of the famous analogy of Spinoza<a id=

          metaphorically, and can be called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“good”</span> only when the term is used without human
          meaning, it may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we have
          unknowable Matter or unknowable Mind at the root of things and
          persons. Both are empty words. The Power universally at work is
          equally unintelligible, equally unfit to be the object of worship
          in the final venture of faith, whether we use the term Matter or
          the term Mind. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxx">[pg

          Alciphron that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is a God in this

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Andrew Baxter's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inquiry
          into the Nature of the Human Soul</span></span>, referred to in
          Berkeley's letter to Johnson, appeared in 1733. It has a chapter on
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Dean Berkeley's Scheme against the
          existence of Matter and a Material World,”</span> which is worthy
          of mention because it is the earliest elaborate criticism of the
          New Principle, although it had then been before the world for more
          than twenty years. The title of the chapter shews Baxter's
          imperfect comprehension of the proposition which he attempts to
          refute. It suggests <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxxi">[pg
          lxxi]</span><a name="Pglxxi" id="Pglxxi" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that Berkeley argued for the non-existence of
          the things we see and touch, instead of for their necessary
          dependence on, or subordination to, realising percipient Mind, so
          far as they are concrete realities. Baxter, moreover, was a Scot;
          and his criticism is interesting as a foretaste of the protracted
          discussion of the <span class="tei tei-q">“ideal theory”</span> by
          Reid and his friends, and later on by Hamilton. But Baxter's book
          was not the first sign of Berkeley's influence in Scotland. We are
          told by Dugald Stewart, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the novelty
          of Berkeley's paradox attracted very powerfully the attention of a
          set of young men who were then prosecuting their studies at
          Edinburgh, who formed themselves into a Society for the express
          purpose of soliciting from him an explanation of some parts of his
          theory which seemed to them obscurely or equivocally expressed. To
          this correspondence the amiable and excellent prelate seems to have
          given every encouragement; and I have been told on the best
          authority that he was accustomed to say that his reasoning had been
          nowhere better understood than by this club of young Scotsmen<a id=

          Thus, and afterwards through Hume and Reid, Berkeley is at the root
          of philosophy in Scotland.</p>

          letters to Prior open a new vista in his history. He was nominated
          to the bishopric of Cloyne in the south of Ireland, and we have now
          to follow him to the remote region which was his home for eighteen
          years. The interest of the philosophic Queen, and perhaps some
          compensation for the Bermuda disappointment, may explain the
          appearance of the metaphysical and social idealist in the place
          where he shone as a star of the first magnitude in the Irish Church

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In May, 1734,
          Berkeley was consecrated as Bishop of Cloyne, in St. Paul's Church,
          Dublin. Except occasional visits, he had been absent from Ireland
          for more than twenty years. He returned to spend eighteen years of
          almost unbroken seclusion in his remote diocese. It suited a
          growing inclination to a recluse, meditative life, which had been
          encouraged by circumstances in Rhode Island. The eastern and
          northern part in the county of Cork formed his diocese, bounded on
          the west by Cork harbour, and on the east by the beautiful
          Blackwater and the mountains of Waterford; the sea, which was its
          southern boundary, approached within two miles of the episcopal
          residence in the village of Cloyne.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as he
          was settled, he resumed study <span class="tei tei-q">“with
          unabated attention,”</span> but still with indifferent health.
          Travelling had become irksome to him, and at Cloyne he was almost
          as much removed as he had been in Rhode Island from the thinking
          world. Cork took the place of Newport; but Cork was twenty miles
          from Cloyne, while Newport was only three miles from Whitehall. His
          episcopal neighbour at Cork was Bishop Browne, the critic of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span>. Isaac Gervais,
          afterwards Dean of Tuam, often enlivened the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“manse-house”</span> at Cloyne by his wit and
          intercourse with the great world. Secker, the Bishop of Bristol,
          and Benson, the Bishop of Gloucester, now and then exchanged
          letters with him, and correspondence was kept up as of old with
          Prior at Dublin and Johnson at Stratford. But there is no trace of
          intercourse with Swift, who was wearing out an unhappy old age, or
          with Pope, almost the only survivor of the brilliant society of
          other years. We are told, indeed, that the beauty of Cloyne
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxxiii">[pg lxxiii]</span><a name=

          described to the bard of Twickenham, by the pen which in former
          days had described Ischia, that Pope was almost moved to visit it.
          And a letter from Secker in February, 1735<a id="noteref_31" name=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Our common friend, Dr. Butler,”</span> he
          adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“hath almost completed a set of
          speculations upon the credibility of religion from its analogy to
          the constitution and course of nature, which I believe in due time
          you will read with pleasure.”</span> Butler's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Analogy</span></span>
          appeared in the following year. But I have found no remains of
          correspondence between Berkeley and their <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“common friend”</span>; the two most illustrious
          religious thinkers of the Anglican communion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he left
          London in 1734 Berkeley was on the eve of what sounded like a
          mathematical controversy, although it was in his intention
          metaphysical, and was suggested by the Seventh Dialogue in
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span>. In one of his letters
          to Prior, early in that year, he told him that though he
          <span class="tei tei-q">“could not read, owing to ill
          health,”</span> yet his thought was as distinct as ever, and that
          for amusement <span class="tei tei-q">“he passed his early hours in
          thinking of certain mathematical matters which may possibly produce
          something<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=
          "#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>.”</span>
          This turned, it seems, upon a form of scepticism among contemporary
          mathematicians, occasioned by the presence of mysteries of
          religion. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Analyst</span></span> was the issue. It was
          followed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxxiv">[pg
          lxxiv]</span><a name="Pglxxiv" id="Pglxxiv" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> by a controversy in which some of the most
          eminent mathematicians took part. <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Mathematica exeunt in mysteria</span></span>
          might have been the motto of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Analyst</span></span>. The assumptions in
          mathematics, it is argued, are as mysterious as those of
          theologians and metaphysicians. Mathematicians cannot translate
          into perfectly intelligible thought their own doctrines in
          fluxions. If man's knowledge of God is rooted in mystery, so too is
          mathematical analysis. Pure science at last loses itself in
          propositions which usefully regulate action, but which cannot be
          comprehended. This is the drift of the argument in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Analyst</span></span>; but perhaps Berkeley's
          inclination to extreme conclusions, and to what is verbally
          paradoxical, led him into doubtful positions in the controversy to
          which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Analyst</span></span> gave rise. Instead of
          ultimate imperfect comprehensibility, he seems to attribute
          absolute contradiction to the Newtonian fluxions. Baxter, in his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Inquiry</span></span>, had asserted that
          things in Berkeley's book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> forced the author
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to suspect that even mathematics may not
          be very sound knowledge at the bottom.”</span> The metaphysical
          argument of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Analyst</span></span> was obscured in a cloud
          of mathematics.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The social
          condition of Ireland attracted Berkeley almost as soon as he was
          settled in Cloyne. He was surrounded by a large native Irish
          population and a small group of English colonists. The natives,
          long governed in the interest of the stranger, had never learned to
          exert and govern themselves. The self-reliance which Berkeley
          preached fifteen years before, as a mean for <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“preventing the ruin of Great Britain,”</span> was more
          wanting in Ireland, where the simplest maxims of social economy
          were neglected. It was a state of things fitted to move one who was
          too independent to permit his aspirations to be confined to the
          ordinary routine of the Irish episcopate, and who could not forget
          the favourite moral maxim of his life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The social chaos
          of Ireland was the occasion of what <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pagelxxv">[pg lxxv]</span><a name="Pglxxv" id="Pglxxv" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to some may be the most interesting of
          Berkeley's writings. His thoughts found vent characteristically in
          a series of penetrating practical queries. The First Part of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Querist</span></span> appeared in 1735,
          anonymously, edited by Dr. Madden of Dublin, who along with Prior
          had lately founded a Society for promoting industrial arts in
          Ireland. The Second and Third Parts were published in the two
          following years. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">A Discourse to Magistrates occasioned by the
          Enormous Licence and Irreligion of the Times</span></span>, which
          appeared in 1736, was another endeavour, with like philanthropic
          intention. And the only important break in his secluded life at
          Cloyne, in eighteen years of residence, was when he went for some
          months to Dublin in 1737, to render social service to Ireland in
          the Irish House of Lords.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His metaphysic,
          at first encountered by ridicule, was now beginning to receive more
          serious treatment. A Scotsman had already recognised it. In 1739
          another and more famous Scotsman, David Hume, refers thus to
          Berkeley in one of the opening sections of his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Treatise of Human
          Nature</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“A very material
          question has been started concerning abstract or general
          ideas—whether they be general or particular in the mind's
          conception of them. A great philosopher, Dr. Berkeley, has disputed
          the received opinion in this particular, and has asserted that all
          general ideas are nothing but particular ones, annexed to a certain
          term which gives them a more extensive signification, and makes
          them recall upon occasion other individuals which are similar to
          them. I look upon this to be one of the greatest and most valuable
          discoveries that has been made of late years in the republic of
          letters.”</span> It does not appear that Berkeley heard of
          Hume.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A curious
          interest began to engage him about this time. The years following
          1739 were years of suffering in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pagelxxvi">[pg lxxvi]</span><a name="Pglxxvi" id="Pglxxvi" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Irish diocese. It was a time of famine
          followed by widespread disease. His correspondence is full of
          allusions to this. It had consequences of lasting importance.
          Surrounded by disease, he pondered remedies. Experience in Rhode
          Island and among American Indians suggested the healing properties
          of tar. Further experiments in tar, combined with meditation and
          much curious reading, deepened and expanded his metaphysical
          philosophy. Tar seemed to grow under his experiments, and in his
          thoughts, into a Panacea for giving health to the organism on which
          living mind in man is meanwhile dependent. This natural dependence
          of health upon tar introduced thoughts of the interdependence of
          all things, and then of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">immediate</span></em> dependence of all in
          nature upon Omnipresent and Omnipotent Mind. The living Mind that
          underlies the phenomena of the universe began to be conceived under
          a new light. Since his return to the life of thought in Rhode
          Island, he had been immersed in Platonic and Neoplatonic
          literature, and in books of mystical Divinity, encouraged perhaps
          by the mystical disposition attributed to his wife. An eccentric
          ingenuity connected the scientific experiments and prescriptions
          with the Idealism of Plato and Plotinus. The natural law according
          to which tar-water was universally restorative set his mind to work
          about the immanence of living Mind. He mused about a medicine thus
          universally beneficial, and the thought occurred that it must be
          naturally charged with 'pure invisible fire, the most subtle and
          elastic of bodies, and the vital element in the universe'; and
          water might be the natural cause which enables this elementary fire
          to be drawn out of tar and transferred to vegetable and animal
          organisms. But the vital fire could be only a natural cause; which
          in truth is no efficient cause at all, but only a sign of divine
          efficiency transmitted through the world of sense: the true cause
          of this and all other natural effects must be the immanent Mind or
          Reason in which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxxvii">[pg
          lxxvii]</span><a name="Pglxxvii" id="Pglxxvii" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> we all participate; for in God we live and
          move and have our being.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is thus that
          Berkeley's thought culminates in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Siris</span></span>,
          that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Inquiries concerning the Virtues of Tar-water, and divers other
          subjects connected together and arising one from
          another</span></span>, which appeared in 1744. This little book
          made more noise at the time of its appearance than any of his
          books; but not because of its philosophy, which was lost in its
          medicinal promise to mankind of immunity from disease. Yet it was
          Berkeley's last attempt to express his ultimate conception of the
          universe in its human and divine relations. When <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Siris</span></span>
          is compared with the book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, the immense
          difference in tone and manner of thought shews the change wrought
          in the intervening years. The sanguine argumentative gladiatorship
          of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> is exchanged for
          pensive speculation, which acknowledges the weakness of human
          understanding, when it is face to face with the Immensities and
          Eternities. Compare the opening sections of the Introduction to the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> with the closing
          sections of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Siris</span></span>. The contingent data of
          our experience are now felt to be insufficient, and there is a more
          or less conscious grounding of the Whole in the eternal and
          immutable Ideas of Reason. <span class="tei tei-q">“Strictly, the
          sense knows nothing. We perceive, indeed, sounds by hearing and
          characters by sight. But we are not therefore said to understand
          them.... Sense and experience acquaint us with the course and
          analogy of appearances and natural effects: thought, reason,
          intellect, introduce us into the knowledge of their causes.... The
          principles of science are neither objects of sense nor imagination:
          intellect and reason are alone the sure guides to truth.”</span> So
          the shifting basis of the earlier thought is found to need support
          in the intellectual and moral faith that must be involved in all
          reasonable human intercourse with the phenomena presented in the
          universe.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxxviii">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inadequate

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the infinite omnipresent Ground, or final sustaining Power,
          immanent in Nature and Man, to which Berkeley had become accustomed
          in Neoplatonic and Alexandrian metaphysics. <span class=

          and the universe of Space and Time) make One Universe, or τὸ Πᾶν.
          But if we should say that all things make One God, this would be an
          erroneous notion of God; but would not amount to atheism, as long
          as Mind or Intellect was admitted to be τὸ ἡγεμονικόν, or the
          governing part.... It will not seem just to fix the imputation of
          atheism upon those philosophers who hold the doctrine of τὸ
          Ἕν.”</span> It is thus that he now regards God. Metaphysics and
          theology are accordingly one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No attempt is
          made in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Siris</span></span> to articulate the universe
          in the light of unifying Mind or Reason. And we are still apt to
          ask what the truth and goodness at the heart of all really mean;
          seeing that, as conceived in human minds, they vary in the gradual
          evolution of intellect and conscience in men. <span lang="la"

          of reality is too much for our articulate intellectual digestion:
          it must be left for omniscience; it transcends finite intelligence
          and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">via media</span></span> of
          human understanding. Man must be satisfied to pass life, in the
          infinitesimal interval between birth and death, as a faith-venture,
          which he may convert into a growing insight, as the generations
          roll on, but which can never be converted into complete knowledge.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“In this state we must be satisfied to make
          the best of those glimpses within our reach. It is Plato's remark
          in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          shallows. If we exercise and bestir ourselves, we may even here
          discover something. The eye by long use comes to see even in the
          darkest cavern; and there is no subject so obscure but we may
          discern some glimpse of truth by long poring on it. Truth is the
          cry of all, but the game of a few. Certainly where it is the chief
          passion it doth not give way to vulgar cares and views; nor is it
          contented with a little ardour in the early time of life: a time
          perhaps to pursue, but not so fit to weigh and revise. He that
          would make a real progress in knowledge must dedicate his age as
          well as his youth, the later growth as well as the first-fruits, at
          the altar of Truth.”</span> Such was Berkeley, and such were his
          last words in philosophy. They may suggest the attitude of Bacon
          when, at a different view-point, he disclaims exhaustive system:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have made a beginning of the work: the
          fortune of the human race will give the issue. For the matter in

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Berkeley's
          central thought throughout his life is concerned with God as the
          one omnipresent and omnipotent Providential Agent in the universe,
          he says little about the other final question, of more exclusively
          human interest, which concerns the destiny of men. That men are
          born into a universe which, as the visible expression of Moral
          Providence, must be scientifically and ethically trustworthy;
          certain not to put man to confusion intellectually or morally,
          seeing that it could not otherwise be trusted for such in our
          ultimate venture of faith—this is one thing. That all persons born
          into it are certain to continue living self-consciously for ever,
          is another thing. This is not obviously implied in the former
          presupposition, whether or not it can be deduced <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="pagelxxx">[pg lxxx]</span><a name="Pglxxx" id=
          "Pglxxx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> from it, or else discovered by
          other means. Although man's environment is essentially Divine, and
          wholly in its smallest details Providential, may not his body, in
          its living organisation from physical birth until physical death,
          be the measure of the continuance of his self-conscious
          personality? Is each man's immortal existence, like God's,
          indispensable?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Doubt about the
          destiny of men after they die is, at the end of the nineteenth
          century, probably more prevalent than doubt about the underlying
          Providence of God, and His constant creative activity; more perhaps
          than it was in the days of Toland, and Collins, and Tindal. Future
          life had been made so familiar to the imagination by the early and
          mediaeval Church, and afterwards by the Puritans, as in Milton,
          Bunyan, and Jonathan Edwards, that it then seemed to the religious
          mind more real than anything that is seen and touched. The habit
          wholly formed by natural science is apt to dissipate this and to
          make a human life lived under conditions wholly strange to its
          <span class="tei tei-q">“minute philosophy”</span> appear
          illusory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A section in the
          book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          which the common argument for the <span class="tei tei-q">“natural
          immortality”</span> of the human soul is reproduced, strengthened
          by his new conception of what the reality of body means, is
          Berkeley's metaphysical contribution for determining between the
          awful alternatives of annihilation or continued self-conscious life
          after physical death. The subject is touched, in a less recondite
          way, in two of his papers in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span>, and in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Discourse</span></span> delivered in Trinity
          College Chapel in 1708, in which a revelation of the immortality of
          men is presented as the special gospel of Jesus Christ. To argue,
          as Berkeley does in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, that men cannot be
          annihilated at death, because they are spiritual substances having
          powers independent of the sequences of nature, implies assumptions
          regarding finite persons which are <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "pagelxxxi">[pg lxxxi]</span><a name="Pglxxxi" id="Pglxxxi" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> open to criticism. The justification in
          reason for our venture of faith that Omnipotent Goodness is at the
          heart of the universe is—that without this presupposition we can
          have no reasonable intercourse, scientific or otherwise, with the
          world of things and persons in which we find ourselves; for reason
          and will are then alike paralysed by universal distrust. But it can
          hardly be maintained <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          priori</span></span> that men, or other spiritual beings in the
          universe, are equally with God indispensable to its natural order;
          so that when they have once entered on conscious existence they
          must <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">always</span></em> continue to exist
          consciously. Is not the philosophical justification of man's hope
          of endless life ethical rather than metaphysical; founded on that
          faith in the justice and goodness of the Universal Mind which has
          to be taken for granted in every attempt to interpret experience,
          with its mixture of good and evil, in this evanescent embodied
          life? Can a life such as this is be <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> for
          men, in a universe that, because it is essentially Divine, must
          operate towards the extinction of the wickedness which now makes it
          a mystery of Omnipotent Goodness?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A cheerful
          optimism appears in Berkeley's habit of thought about death, as we
          have it in his essays in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span>: a sanguine
          apprehension of a present preponderance of good, and consequent
          anticipation of greater good after death; unlike those whose
          pessimistic temperament induces a lurid picture of eternal moral
          disorder. But his otherwise active imagination seldom makes
          philosophy a meditation upon death. He does not seem to have
          exercised himself in the way those do who find in the prospect of
          being in the twenty-first century as they were in the first, what
          makes them appalled that they have ever come at all into transitory
          percipient life; or as those others who recoil from an unbodied
          life after physical death, as infinitely more appalling than the
          thought of being transported <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          system. In one of his letters to Johnson<a id="noteref_36" name=

          does approach the unbodied life, and in a characteristic way:—</p>

          material substance. It is sufficient for that purpose that we allow
          sensible bodies, i.e. such as are immediately perceived by sight
          and touch; the existence of which I am so far from questioning, as
          philosophers are used to do, that I establish it, I think, upon
          evident principles. Now it seems very easy to conceive the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          (i.e. divested from those limits and laws of motion and perception
          with which she is embarrassed here) and to exercise herself on new
          ideas, without the intervention of these tangible things we call
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bodies</span></em>. It is even very possible
          to apprehend how the soul may have ideas of colour without an eye,

          thus be supposed to have all our present sensuous experience in an
          unbodied state, this does not enable one to conceive how unbodied

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's
          tar-water enthusiasm lasted throughout the rest of his life, and
          found vent in letters and pamphlets in support of his Panacea, from
          1744 till 1752. Notwithstanding this, he was not forgetful of other
          interests—ecclesiastical, and the social ones which he included in
          his large meaning of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ecclesiastical.”</span> The Rising under Charles
          Edward in 1745 was the occasion of a <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Letter to the Roman
          Catholics of Cloyne</span></span>, characteristically humane
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxxxiii">[pg
          lxxxiii]</span><a name="Pglxxxiii" id="Pglxxxiii" class=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Exhortation to the Roman Catholic Clergy of
          Ireland</span></span> in a similar spirit; and this unwonted
          courtesy of an Irish Protestant bishop was received by those to
          whom it was addressed in a corresponding temper.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is difficult
          to determine Berkeley's relation to rival schools or parties in
          Church and State. His disposition was too singular and independent
          for a partisan. Some of his early writings, as we have seen, were
          suspected of high Tory and Jacobite leanings; but his arguments in
          the suspected <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Discourse</span></span> were such as ordinary
          Tories and Jacobites failed to understand, and the tenor of his
          words and actions was in the best sense liberal. In religious
          thought <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Siris</span></span> might place him among
          latitudinarians; perhaps in affinity with the Cambridge Platonists.
          His true place is foremost among the religious philosophers of the
          Anglican Church; the first to prepare the religious problem for the
          light in which we are invited to look at the universe by modern
          agnostics, and under the modern conception of natural evolution. He
          is the most picturesque figure in that Anglican succession which,
          in the seventeenth century, includes Hooker and Cudworth; in the
          eighteenth, Clarke and Butler; and in the nineteenth, may we say
          Coleridge, in lack of a representative in orders; although Mansel,
          Maurice, Mozley, and Jowett are not to be forgotten, nor Isaac
          Taylor among laymen<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href=

          Newman and Arnold, illustrious otherwise, are hardly

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A more pensive
          tone runs through the closing years at Cloyne. Attempts were made
          in vain to withdraw him from the <span class="tei tei-q">“remote
          corner”</span> to which he had been so long confined. His friends
          urged his claims for the Irish Primacy. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          am no man's rival or competitor in this matter,”</span> were his
          words to Prior. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not in love with

          strange faces, and a hurry of affairs often insignificant. For my
          own private satisfaction, I had rather be master of my time than
          wear a diadem.”</span> Letters to his American friends, Johnson and
          Clap, shew him still moved by the inspiration which carried him
          over the Atlantic, and record his influence in the development of
          American colleges<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=

          home education of his three sons was another interest. We are told
          by his widow that <span class="tei tei-q">“he would not trust his
          sons to mercenary hands. Though old and sickly, he performed the
          constant tedious task himself.”</span> Of the fruit of this home
          education there is little to tell. The death of William, his
          favourite boy, in 1751, <span class="tei tei-q">“was thought to
          have struck too close to his father's heart.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am a man,”</span> so he writes, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“retired from the amusements, politics, visits, and
          what the world calls pleasure. I had a little friend, educated
          always under mine own eye, whose painting delighted me, whose music
          ravished me, and whose lively gay spirit was a continual feast. It
          has pleased God to take him hence.”</span> The eldest son, Henry,
          born in Rhode Island, did not long survive his father. George, the
          third son, was destined for Oxford, and this destiny was connected
          with a new project. The <span class="tei tei-q">“life
          academico-philosophical,”</span> which he sought in vain to realise
          in Bermuda, he now hoped to find for himself in the city of

          is,”</span> he wrote to Prior as early as September 1746,

          Berkeley's letters which we have is to Dean Gervais. It expresses
          the feeling with which in April, 1752, he was contemplating life,
          on the eve of his departure from Cloyne.</p>

          and especially to have to do with great persons and great affairs.
          The evening of life I choose to pass in a quiet retreat. Ambitious
          projects, intrigues and quarrels of statesmen, are things I have
          formerly been amused with, but they now seem to be a vain, fugitive

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Four months
          after this, Berkeley saw Cloyne for the last time. In August he
          quitted it for Oxford, which he had long pictured in imagination as
          the ideal home of his old age. When he left Cork in the vessel
          which carried his wife, his daughter, and himself to Bristol, he
          was prostrated by weakness, and had to be taken from Bristol to
          Oxford on a horse-litter. It was late in August when they arrived
          there<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href=
          "#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our picture of
          Berkeley at Oxford is dim. According to tradition he occupied a
          house in Holywell Street, near the gardens of New College and not
          far from the cloisters of Magdalen. It was a changed world to him.
          While he was exchanging Ireland for England, death was removing old
          English friends. Before he left Cloyne he must have heard of the
          death of Butler in June, at Bath, where Benson, at the request of
          Secker, affectionately watched the last hours of the author of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We hear of study
          resumed in improved health in the home in Holy well Street. In
          October a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          various Subjects</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the
          Bishop of Cloyne,”</span> appeared simultaneously in London and
          Dublin. The Tracts were reprints, with the exception of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Further
          Thoughts on Tar-water</span></span>, which may have been written
          before he left Ireland. The third edition of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span> also appeared in this
          autumn. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Siris</span></span> is the latest record of
          his philosophical thought. A comparison of the <span class=

          Book</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          advancement. After the sanguine beginning perhaps the comparison
          leaves a sense of disappointment, when we find metaphysics mixed up
          with mathematics in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Analyst</span></span>, and metaphysics
          obscurely mixed up with medicine in <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is curious
          that, although in 1752 David Hume's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Treatise of Human
          Nature</span></span> had been before the world for thirteen years
          and his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Inquiry concerning Human
          Understanding</span></span> for four years, there is no allusion to
          Hume by Berkeley. He was Berkeley's immediate successor in the
          eighteenth-century evolution of European thought. The sceptical
          criticism of Hume was applied to the dogmatic religious philosophy
          of Berkeley, to be followed in its turn by the abstractly rational
          and the moral reconstructive criticism of Kant. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span> is, however, expressly
          referred to by Hume; indirectly, too, throughout the religious
          agnosticism of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Inquiry</span></span>, also afterwards in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogues
          on Natural Religion</span></span>, in a vindication of minute
          philosophy by profounder reasonings than those which satisfied
          Lysicles and Alciphron. Berkeley, Hume, and Kant are the three
          significant philosophical figures of their century, each holding
          the supreme place successively in its beginning, middle, and later
          years. Perhaps Reid in Scotland did more than any other in his
          generation to make Berkeley known; not, however, for his true work
          in constructive <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagelxxxvii">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ideal life
          in Oxford did not last long. On the evening of Sunday, January 14,
          1753, Berkeley was suddenly confronted by the mystery of death.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“As he was sitting with my mother, my
          sister, and myself,”</span> so his son wrote to Johnson at
          Stratford, in October, <span class="tei tei-q">“suddenly, and
          without the least previous notice or pain, he was removed to the
          enjoyment of eternal rewards; and although all possible means were
          instantly used, no symptom of life ever appeared after; nor could
          the physicians assign any cause for his death. He arrived at Oxford
          on August 25, and had received great benefit from the change of
          air, and by God's blessing on tar-water, insomuch that for some
          years he had not been in better health than he was the instant
          before he left us<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's
          juvenile <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Commonplace Book</span></span> is a small
          quarto volume, in his handwriting, found among the Berkeley
          manuscripts in possession of the late Archdeacon Rose. It was first
          published in 1871, in my edition of Berkeley's Works. It consists
          of occasional thoughts, mathematical, physical, ethical, and
          metaphysical, set down in miscellaneous fashion, for private use,
          as they arose in the course of his studies at Trinity College,
          Dublin. They are full of the fervid enthusiasm that was natural to
          him, and of sanguine expectations of the issue of the prospective
          authorship for which they record preparations. On the title-page is
          written, <span class="tei tei-q">“G. B. Trin. Dub. alum.,”</span>
          with the date 1705, when he was twenty years of age. The entries
          are the gradual accumulation of the next three years, in one of
          which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Arithmetica</span></span> and the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miscellanea
          Mathematica</span></span> made their appearance. The <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Theory of
          Vision</span></span>, given to the world in 1709, was evidently
          much in his mind, as well as the sublime conception of the material
          world in its necessary subordination to the spiritual world, of
          which he delivered himself in his book of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, in
          1710.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This disclosure
          of Berkeley's thoughts about things, in the years preceding the
          publication of his first essays, is indeed a precious record of the
          initial struggles of ardent philosophical genius. It places the
          reader in intimate companionship with him when he was beginning to
          awake into intellectual and spiritual life. We hear him
          soliloquising. We see him trying to translate into reasonableness
          our crude inherited beliefs about the material world and the
          natural order of the universe, self-conscious personality, and the
          Universal Power or Providence—all under the sway of a new
          determining Principle which was taking profound possession of his
          soul. He finds that he has only to look at the concrete things of
          sense in the light of this great discovery to see the artificially
          induced perplexities of the old philosophers disappear, along with
          their imposing abstractions, which turn out empty words. The
          thinking is throughout fresh and sincere; sometimes impetuous and
          one-sided; the outcome of a mind indisposed to take things upon
          trust, resolved to inquire freely, a rebel against the tyranny of
          language, morally burdened with the consciousness of a new
          world-transforming conception, which duty to mankind obliged him to
          reveal, although his message was sure to offend. Men like to regard
          things as they have been wont. This new conception of the
          surrounding world—the impotence of Matter, and its subordinate
          office in the Supreme Economy must, he foresees, disturb those
          accustomed to treat outward things as the only realities, and who
          do not care to ask what constitutes reality. Notwithstanding the
          ridicule and ill-will that his transformed material world was sure
          to meet with, amongst the many who accept empty words instead of
          genuine insight, he was resolved to deliver himself of his thoughts
          through the press, but with the politic conciliation of a
          persuasive Irish pleader.</p>

          Book</span></span> steadily recognises the adverse influence of one
          insidious foe. Its world-transforming-Principle <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has been obscured by <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the mist and veil of words.”</span> The abstractions
          of metaphysicians, which poison human language, had to be driven
          out of the author's mind before he could see the light, and must be
          driven out of the minds of others before they could be got to see
          it along with him: the concrete world as realisable only in
          percipient mind is with difficulty introduced into the vacant
          place. <span class="tei tei-q">“The chief thing I pretend to is
          only to remove the mist and veil of words.”</span> He exults in the
          transformed mental scene that then spontaneously rises before him.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“My speculations have had the same effect
          upon me as visiting foreign countries,—in the end I return where I
          was before, get my heart at ease, and enjoy myself with more
          satisfaction. The philosophers lose their abstract matter; the
          materialists lose their abstract extension; the profane lose their
          extended deity. Pray what do the rest of mankind lose?”</span> This
          beneficent revolution seemed to be the issue of a simple
          recognition of the fact, that the true way of regarding the world
          we see and touch is to regard it as consisting of ideas or
          phenomena that are presented to human senses, somehow regularly
          ordered, and the occasions of pleasure or pain to us as we conform
          to or rebel against their natural order. This is the surrounding
          universe—at least in its relations to us, and that is all in it
          that we have to do with. <span class="tei tei-q">“I know
          not,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“what is meant by
          things considered in themselves, i.e. in abstraction. This is
          nonsense. Thing and idea are words of much about the same extent
          and meaning. Existence is not conceivable without perception and
          volition. I only declare the meaning of the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">existence</span></em>, as far as I can
          comprehend it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Commonplace Book</span></span> we see the
          youth at Trinity College forging the weapons which he was soon to
          direct against the materialism and scepticism of the generation
          into which he was born. Here are rough drafts, crude hints of
          intended arguments, probing of unphilosophical mathematicians—even
          Newton and Descartes, memoranda <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of facts, more or less relevant, on their way
          into the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay on Vision</span></span> and the treatise
          on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>—seeds of the
          philosophy that was to be gradually unfolded in his life and in his
          books. We watch the intrepid thinker, notwithstanding the
          inexperience of youth, more disposed to give battle to
          mathematicians and metaphysicians than to submit even provisionally
          to any human authority. It does not seem that his scholarship or
          philosophical learning was extensive. Descartes, Malebranche, and
          Locke were his intimates; Hobbes and Spinoza were not unknown to
          him; Newton and some lesser lights among the mathematicians are
          often confronted. He is more rarely in company with the ancients or
          the mediaevalists. No deep study of Aristotle appears, and there is
          even a disposition to disparage Plato. He seeks for his home in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“new philosophy”</span> of experience;
          without anticipations of Kant, as the critic of what is presupposed
          in the scientific reliability of any experience, against whom his
          almost blind zeal against abstractions would have set him at this
          early stage. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pure intellect I understand
          not at all,”</span> is one of his entries. He asks himself,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What becomes of the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aeternae veritates</span></span>?”</span> and
          his reply is, <span class="tei tei-q">“They vanish.”</span> When he
          tells himself that <span class="tei tei-q">“we must with the mob
          place certainty in the senses,”</span> the words are apt to suggest
          that the senses are our only source of knowledge, but I suppose his
          meaning is that the senses must be trustworthy, as 'the mob'
          assume. Yet occasionally he uses language which looks like an
          anticipation of David Hume, as when he calls mind <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a congeries of perceptions. Take away
          perceptions,”</span> he adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“and you take
          away mind. Put the perceptions and you put the mind. The
          understanding seemeth not to differ from its perceptions and
          ideas.”</span> He seems unconscious of the total scepticism which
          such expressions, when strictly interpreted, are found to involve.
          But after all, the reader must not apply rigorous rules of
          interpretation to random entries or provisional <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay
          towards a New Theory of Vision</span></span> was meant to prepare
          the way for the exposition and defence of the new theory of the
          material world, its natural order, and its relation to Spirit, that
          is contained in his book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> and in the relative
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span>, which speedily
          followed. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> was the firstfruits of his
          early philosophical studies at Dublin. It was also the first
          attempt to show that our apparently immediate Vision of Space and
          of bodies extended in three-dimensioned space, is either tacit or
          conscious inference, occasioned by constant association of the
          phenomena of which alone we are visually percipient with assumed
          realities of our tactual and locomotive experience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
          edition of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> appeared early in 1709,
          when its author was about twenty-four years of age. A second
          edition, with a few verbal changes and an Appendix, followed before
          the end of that year. Both were issued in Dublin, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“printed by Aaron Rhames, at the back of <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Dick's Coffeehouse, for Jeremy Pepyat,
          bookseller in Skinner Row.”</span> In March, 1732, a third edition,
          without the Appendix, was annexed to <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron,</span></span> on account of its
          relation to the Fourth Dialogue in that book. This was the author's
          last revision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the present
          edition the text of this last edition is adopted, after collation
          with those preceding. The Appendix has been restored, and also the
          Dedication to Sir John Percival, which appeared only in the first
          edition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A due
          appreciation of Berkeley's theory of seeing, and his conception of
          the visible world, involves a study, not merely of this tentative
          juvenile <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>, but also of its fuller
          development and application in his more matured works. This has
          been commonly forgotten by his critics.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Various
          circumstances contribute to perplex and even repel the reader of
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>, making it less fit to be
          an easy avenue of approach to Berkeley's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Its occasion and
          design, and its connexion with his spiritual conception of the
          material world, are suggested in Sections 43 and 44 of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>. Those sections are a
          key to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>. They inform us that in
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> the author intentionally
          uses language which seems to attribute a reality independent of all
          percipient spirit to the ideas or phenomena presented in Touch; it
          being beside his purpose, he says, to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“examine and refute”</span> that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“vulgar error”</span> in <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          work on Vision.”</span> This studied reticence of a verbally
          paradoxical conception of Matter, in reasonings about vision which
          are fully intelligible only under that conception, is one cause of
          a want of philosophical lucidity in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          circumstance adds to the embarrassment of those who approach the

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span>. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> offers no exception to the
          lax employment of equivocal words familiar in the early literature
          of English philosophy, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg
          097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          but which is particularly inconvenient in the subtle discussions to
          which we are here introduced. At the present day we are perhaps
          accustomed to more precision and uniformity in the philosophical
          use of language; at any rate we connect other meanings than those
          here intended with some of the leading words. It is enough to refer
          to such terms as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">notion</span></em>,

          is difficult for the modern reader to revive and remember the
          meanings which Berkeley intends by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">notion</span></em>—so significant in his
          vocabulary; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">touch</span></em> with him connotes muscular
          and locomotive experience as well as the pure sense of contact.
          Interchange of the terms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "font-style: italic">without the eye</span></em> is confusing, if
          we forget that Berkeley implies that percipient mind is virtually
          coextensive with our bodily organism, so that being <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“without”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“at a
          distance from”</span> our bodies is being at a distance from the
          percipient mind. I have tried in the annotations to relieve some of
          these ambiguities, of which Berkeley himself warns us (cf. sect.

          section onwards the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> naturally falls into six
          Parts, devoted successively to the proof of the six following
          theses regarding the relation of Sight to finite spaces and to
          things extended:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I. (Sect. 2-51.)
          Distance, or outness from the eye in the line of vision, is not
          seen: it is only suggested to the mind by visible phenomena and by
          sensations felt in the eye, all which are somehow its arbitrarily
          constituted and non-resembling Signs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">II. (Sect.
          52-87.) Magnitude, or the amount of space that objects of sense
          occupy, is really invisible: we only see a greater or less quantity
          of colour, and colour depends upon percipient mind: our supposed
          visual perceptions of real magnitude are only our own
          interpretations of the tactual meaning of the colours we see, and
          of sensations felt in the eye, which are its Signs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">III. (Sect.
          88-120.) Situation of objects of sense, or their real relation to
          one another in ambient space, is invisible: what we see is variety
          in the relations of colours to one another: our supposed vision of
          real tangible locality is only our interpretation of its visual
          non-resembling Signs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">IV. (Sect.
          121-46.) There is no object that is presented in common to Sight
          and Touch: space or extension, which has the best claim to be their
          common object, is specifically as well as numerically different in
          Sight and in Touch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">V. (Sect.
          147-48.) The explanation of the tactual significance of the visible
          and visual Signs, upon which human experience proceeds, is offered
          in the Theory that all visible phenomena are arbitrary signs in
          what is virtually <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg
          099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Language of Nature, addressed by God to the senses and
          intelligence of Man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">VI. (Sect.
          149-60.) The true object studied in Geometry is the kind of
          Extension given in Touch, not that given in Sight: real Extension
          in all its phases is tangible, not visible: colour is the only
          immediate object of Sight, and colour being mind-dependent
          sensation, cannot be realised without percipient mind. These
          concluding sections are supplementary to the main argument.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that
          distance or outness is invisible is sometimes regarded as
          Berkeley's contribution to the theory of seeing. It is rather the
          assumption on which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> proceeds (sect. 2). The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> does not prove this
          invisibility, but seeks to shew how, notwithstanding, we learn to
          find outness through seeing. That the relation between the visual
          signs of outness, on the one hand, and the real distance which they
          signify, on the other, is in all cases arbitrary, and discovered
          through experience, is the burden of sect. 2-40. The previously
          recognised signs of <span class="tei tei-q">“considerably
          remote”</span> distances, are mentioned (sect. 3). But <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">near</span></em>
          distance was supposed to be inferred by a visual geometry—and to be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“suggested,”</span> not signified by
          arbitrary signs. The determination of the visual signs which
          suggest outness, near and remote, is Berkeley's professed discovery
          regarding vision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An induction of
          the visual signs which <span class="tei tei-q">“suggest”</span>
          distance, is followed (sect. 43) by an assertion of the wholly
          sensuous reality of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">colour</span></em>, which is acknowledged to
          be the only immediate object of sight. Hence <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visible</span></em>
          extension, consisting in colour, must be dependent for its
          realisation upon sentient or percipient mind. It is then argued
          (sect. 44) that this mind-dependent visible outness has no
          resemblance to the tangible reality (sect. 45). This is the first
          passage in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> in which Touch and its
          data are formally brought into view. Tactual or <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> locomotive experience, it is implied,
          is needed to infuse true reality into our conceptions of distance
          or outness. This cannot be got from seeing any more than from
          hearing, or tasting, or smelling. It is as impossible to see and
          touch the same object as it is to hear and touch the same object.
          Visible objects and ocular sensations can only be <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal
          signs</span></em> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">real things</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sections in
          which Touch is thus introduced are among the most important in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>. They represent the
          outness given in hearing as wholly sensuous, ideal, or
          mind-dependent: they recognise as more truly real that got by
          contact and locomotion. But if this is all that man can see, it
          follows that his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">visible</span></em> world, at any rate,
          becomes real only in and through percipient mind. The problem of an
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span> is thus, to explain <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> the
          visible world of extended colour can inform us of tangible
          realities, which it does not in the least resemble, and with which
          it has no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> connexion. That visible
          phenomena, or else certain organic sensations involved in seeing
          (sect. 3, 16, 21, 27), gradually <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suggest</span></em>
          the real or tangible outness with which they are connected in the
          divinely constituted system of nature, is the explanation which now
          begins to dawn upon us.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here an
          ambiguity in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span> appears. It concludes that
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">visible</span></em> world cannot be real
          without percipient realising mind, i.e. not otherwise than ideally:
          yet the argument seems to take for granted that we are percipient
          of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tangible</span></em> world that is independent
          of percipient realising mind. The reader is apt to say that the
          tangible world must be as dependent on percipient mind for its
          reality as the visible world is concluded to be, and for the same
          reason. This difficulty was soon afterwards encountered in the book
          of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, where the worlds of
          sight and touch are put on the same level; and the possibility of
          unperceived reality in both cases is denied; on the ground that a
          material world cannot be realised in the total <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> absence of Spirit—human and divine. The
          term <span class="tei tei-q">“external”</span> may still be applied
          to tactual and locomotive phenomena alone, if men choose; but this
          not because of the ideal character of what is seen, and the unideal
          reality of what is touched, but only because tactual perceptions
          are found to be more firm and steady than visual. Berkeley
          preferred in this way to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">insinuate</span></em> his new conception of
          the material world by degrees, at the risk of exposing this
          juvenile and tentative <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          incoherence.</p>

          the outness or distance of things from the organ of sight having
          been thus explained, in what I call the First Part of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>, the Second and Third
          Parts (sect. 52-120) argue for the invisibility of real extension
          in two other relations, viz. magnitude and locality or situation.
          An induction of the visual signs of tangible size and situation is
          given in those sections. The result is applied to solve two
          problems then notable in optics, viz. (1) the reason for the
          greater visible size of the horizontal moon than of the moon in its
          meridian (sect. 67-87); and (2) the fact that objects are placed
          erect in vision only on condition that their images on the retina
          are inverted (sect. 88-120). Here the antithesis between the ideal
          world of coloured extension, and the real world of resistant
          extension is pressed with vigour. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“high”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“low”</span>
          of the visible world is not the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“high”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“low”</span>
          of the tangible world (sect. 91-106). There is no resemblance and
          no necessary relation, between those two so-called extensions; not
          even when the number of visible objects happen to coincide with the
          number of tangible objects of which they are the visual signs, e.g.
          the visible and tangible fingers on the hand: for the born-blind,
          on first receiving sight, could not parcel out the visible
          phenomena in correspondence with the tangible.</p><span class=

          a specific as well as a numerical difference between the original
          data of sight and the data of touch and locomotion. Sight and touch
          perceive nothing in common. Extension in its various relations
          differs in sight from extension in touch. Coloured extension, which
          alone is visible, is found to be different in kind from resistant
          extension, which alone is tangible. And if actually perceived or
          concrete extensions differ thus, the question is determined. For
          all extension with which man can be concerned must be concrete
          (sect. 23). Extension in the abstract is meaningless (sect.
          124-25). What remains is to marshal the scattered evidence, and to
          guard the foregoing conclusions against objections. This is
          attempted in sections 128-46.</p>

          to determine the sort of extension—visible or tangible—with which
          Geometry is concerned. In concluding that it is tangible, he tries
          to picture the mental state of Idominians, or unbodied spirits,
          endowed with visual perceptions <em class=

          distances, sizes, and situations of things, is a question which
          some might prefer to deal with experimentally—by trial of the
          experience of persons in circumstances fitted to supply an answer.

          "Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Of this sort would
          be the experience of the born-blind, immediately after their sight
          has been restored; the conception of extension and its relations
          found in persons who continue from birth unable to see; the
          experience (if it could be got) of persons always destitute of all
          tactual and locomotive perceptions, but familiar with vision; and
          the facts of seeing observed in infants of the human species, and
          in the lower animals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley did not
          try to verify his conclusions in this way. Here and there (sect.
          41, 42, 79, 92-99, 103, 106, 110, 128, 132-37), he conjectures what
          the first visual experience of those rescued from born-blindness is
          likely to be; he also speculates, as we have seen, about the
          experience of unbodied spirits supposed to be able to see, but
          unable to touch or move (sect. 153-59); and in the Appendix he
          refers, in confirmation of his New Theory, to a reported case of
          one born blind who had obtained sight. But he forms his Theory
          independently of those delicate and difficult investigations. His
          testing facts were sought introspectively. Indeed those
          physiologists and mental philosophers who have since tried to
          determine what vision in its purity is, by cases either of
          communicated sight or of continued born-blindness, have illustrated
          the truth of Diderot's remark—<span class="tei tei-q">“préparer et

          imperfectly known to the ancient philosophers. Aristotle, indeed,
          speaks of colour as the only proper object of sight; but, in

          Sensibles appears at first to contradict Berkeley's doctrine of the
          heterogeneity of the ideal visible and the real tangible worlds.
          Aristotle, however, seems to question the immediate perceptibility
          of Common Sensibles, and to regard them as realised through the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some writers in
          Optics, in mediaeval times, and in early modern philosophy,
          advanced beyond Aristotle, in explaining the relation of our
          matured notion of distance to what we originally perceive in
          seeing, and in the fifteenth century it was discovered by Maurolyco
          that the rays of light from the object converge to a focus in the
          eye; but I have not been able to trace even the germ of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New
          Theory</span></span> in these speculations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Excepting some
          hints by Descartes, Malebranche was among the first dimly to
          anticipate Berkeley, in resolving our supposed power of seeing
          outness into an interpretation <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of visual signs which we learn by experience
          to understand. The most important part of Malebranche's account of
          seeing is contained in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Recherche de la Vérité</span></span> (Liv. I.
          ch. 9), in one of those chapters in which he discusses the frequent
          fallaciousness of the senses, and in particular of our visual
          perceptions of extension. He accounts for their inevitable
          uncertainty by assigning them not to sense but to misinterpretation

          the ideas we receive by sensation are often, in grown people,
          altered by the judgment, without our taking notice of it. When we
          set before our eyes a round globe of any uniform colour, e.g. gold,
          alabaster, or jet, it is certain that the idea thereby imprinted in
          our mind is of a flat circle, variously shadowed, with several
          degrees of light and brightness coming to our eyes. But, we having
          by use been accustomed to perceive what kind of appearance convex
          bodies are wont to make in us, what alterations are made
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name=

          light by the difference in the sensible figures of bodies—the
          judgment presently, by an habitual custom, alters the appearances
          into their causes; so that, from that which is truly variety of
          shadow or colour, collecting the figure, it makes it pass for a
          mark of figure, and frames to itself the perception of a convex
          figure and an uniform colour, when the idea we receive from them is
          only a plane variously coloured, as is evident in
          painting.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To which purpose I shall here insert a problem of that
          very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the learned
          and worthy Mr. Molyneux, which he was pleased to send me in a
          letter some months since, and it is this:—Suppose a man born blind,
          and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a
          cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same
          bigness, so as to tell, when he felt the one and the other, which
          is the cube and which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and the
          sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: quere,
          whether, by his sight, before he touched them, he could not
          distinguish and tell, which is the globe and which the cube? To
          which the acute and judicious proposer answers: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Not.’</span> For, though he has obtained the
          experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch; yet he has
          not obtained the experience that what affects his touch so and so,
          must affect his sight so and so; so that a protuberant angle in the
          cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as
          it does in the cube.—I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I
          am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this his problem, and
          am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able
          to say with certainty which was the globe and which the cube,
          whilst he only saw them; though he would unerringly name them by
          his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference in
          their figures felt.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an

          consider how much he may be beholden to experience, improvement,
          and acquired notions, where he thinks he had not the least use of,
          or help from them: and the rather because this observing gentleman
          further adds that, having, upon the occasion of my book, proposed
          this problem to divers very ingenious men, he hardly ever met with
          one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true, till
          by hearing his reasons they were convinced.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          those received by sight: because sight, the most comprehensive of
          the senses, conveying to our minds the ideas of light and colours,
          which are peculiar only to that sense; and also the far different
          ideas of space, figure, and motion, the several varieties of which
          change the appearance of its proper object, i.e. light and colours;
          we bring ourselves by use to judge of the one by the other. This,
          in many cases, by a settled habit, in things whereof we have
          frequent experience, is performed so constantly and so quick, that
          we take that for the perception of our sensation, which is an idea
          formed by our judgment; so that one, i.e. that of sensation, serves
          only to excite the other, and is scarce taken notice of itself; as
          a man who reads or hears with attention and understanding takes
          little notice of the character or sounds, but of the ideas that are
          excited in him by them.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          notice, if we consider how very quick the actions of the mind are
          performed; for, as itself is thought to take up no space, to have
          no extension, so its actions seem to require no time, but many of
          them seem to be crowded into an instant. I speak this in comparison
          of the actions of the body.... Secondly, we shall not be much
          surprised that this is done with us in so little notice, if we
          consider how the facility we get of doing things, by a custom of
          doing, makes them often pass in us without notice. Habits,

          are begun very early, come at last to produce actions in us which
          often escape our observation.... And therefore it is not so strange
          that our mind should often change the idea of its sensation into
          that of its judgment, and make the one serve only to excite the
          other, without our taking notice of it.”</span> (<span class=

          in 1690) of Locke's friend and correspondent William Molyneux,
          whose son was Berkeley's pupil, illustrate Locke's statements, and
          may be compared with the opening sections of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span>:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In plain vision the estimate we make of the distance
          of objects (especially when so far removed that the interval
          between our two eyes bears no sensible proportion thereto, or when
          looked upon with one eye only) is rather the act of our judgment
          than of sense; and acquired by exercise, and a faculty of
          comparing, rather than natural. For, distance of itself is not to
          be perceived; for, 'tis a line (or a length) presented to our eye
          with its end toward us, which must therefore be only a point, and
          that is invisible. Wherefore distance is chiefly perceived by means
          of interjacent bodies, as by the earth, mountains, hills, fields,
          trees, houses, &amp;c. Or by the estimate we make of the
          comparative magnitude of bodies, or of their faint colours, &amp;c.
          These I say are the chief means of apprehending the distance of
          objects that are considerably remote. But as to nigh objects—to
          whose distance the interval of the eyes bears a sensible
          proportion—their distance is perceived by the turn of the eyes, or
          by the angle of the optic axes (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gregorii Opt.
          Promot.</span></span> prop. 28). This was the opinion of the
          ancients, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg
          109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Alhazen, Vitellio, &amp;c. And though the ingenious Jesuit Tacquet
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Opt.
          Lib. I.</span></span> prop. 2) disapprove thereof, and objects
          against it a new notion of Gassendus (of a man's seeing only with
          one eye at a time one and the same object), yet this notion of
          Gassendus being absolutely false (as I could demonstrate were it
          not beside my present purpose), it makes nothing against this
          opinion.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Wherefore, distance being only a line and not of
          itself perceivable, if an object were conveyed to the eye by one
          single ray only, there were no other means of judging of its
          distance but by some of those hinted before. Therefore when we
          estimate the distance of nigh objects, either we take the help of
          both eyes; or else we consider the pupil of one eye as having
          breadth, and receiving a parcel of rays from each radiating point.
          And, according to the various inclinations of the rays from one
          point on the various parts of the pupil, we make our estimate of
          the distance of the object. And therefore (as is said before), by
          one single eye we can only judge of the distance of such objects to
          whose distance the breadth of the pupil has a sensible
          proportion.... For, it is observed before (prop. 29, sec. 2, see
          also <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Gregorii Opt. Promot.</span></span> prop. 29)
          that for viewing objects remote and nigh, there are requisite
          various conformations of the eye—the rays from nigh objects that
          fall on the eye diverging more than those from more remote
          objects.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          particular that the eye cannot originally perceive an extension
          that is beyond itself, and that perception of trinal space is due
          to what we experience in touch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Voltaire and

          with D'Alembert, Diderot, Buffon, and other French philosophers. In
          Germany we have allusions to it in the Berlin Memoirs and
          elsewhere; but, although known by name, if not in its distinctive
          principle and latent idealism, it has not obtained <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the consideration which its author's
          developed theory of the material as well as the visible world has

          reasoning of Berkeley's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Its influence is
          apparent in British philosophy. The following passages in Hartley's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Observations on Man</span></span>, published
          in 1749, illustrate the extent to which some of the distinctive
          parts of the new doctrine were at that time received by an eminent
          English psychologist:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Distance is judged of by the quantity of motion, and
          figure by the relative quantity of distance.... And, as the sense
          of sight is much more extensive and expedite than feeling, we judge
          of tangible qualities chiefly by sight, which therefore may be
          considered, agreeably to Bishop Berkeley's remark, as a
          philosophical language for the ideas of feeling; being, for the
          most part, an adequate representative of them, and a language
          common to all mankind, and in which they all agree very nearly,
          after a moderate degree of experience.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“However, if the informations from touch and sight
          disagree at any time, we are always to depend upon touch, as that
          which, according to the usual ways of speaking upon these subjects,
          is the true representation of the essential properties, i.e. as the
          earnest and presage of what other tangible impressions the body
          under consideration will make upon our feeling in other
          circumstances; also what changes it will produce in other bodies;
          of which again we are to determine by our feeling, if the visual
          language should not happen to correspond to it exactly. And it is
          from this difference that we call the touch the reality, light the
          representative—also that a person born blind may foretell with
          certainty, from his present tangible impressions, what others would
          follow upon varying the circumstances; whereas, if we could suppose
          a person to be born without <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> feeling, and to arrive at man's estate, he
          could not, from his present visible impressions, judge what others
          would follow upon varying the circumstances. Thus the picture of a
          knife, drawn so well as to deceive his eye, would not, when applied
          to another body, produce the same change of visible impressions as
          a real knife does, when it separates the parts of the body through
          which it passes. But the touch is not liable to these deceptions.
          As it is therefore the fundamental source of information in respect
          of the essential properties of matter, it may be considered as our
          first and principal key to the knowledge of the external
          world.”</span> (Prop. 30.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other parts
          of Hartley's book (e.g. Prop. 58) the relation of our visual
          judgments of magnitude, figure, motion, distance, and position to
          the laws of association is explained, and the associating
          circumstances by which these judgments are formed are enumerated in
          detail.</p>

          Phenomena of Vision</span></span> (Edinburgh, 1759), is an
          exception to the consent which the doctrine had then widely
          secured. He maintains, in opposition to Berkeley, that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the judgments we form of the situation and distance of
          visible objects, depend not on custom and experience, but on
          original instinct, to which mind is subject in our embodied

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's
          Theory of Vision, in so far as it resolves our visual perceptions
          of distance into interpretation of arbitrary signs, received the
          qualified approbation of Reid, in his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inquiry into the
          Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense</span></span> (1764).
          He criticises it in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Inquiry</span></span>, where the doctrine of
          visual signs, of which Berkeley's whole philosophy is a
          development, is accepted, and to some extent applied. With Reid it
          is divorced, however, from the Berkeleian conception of the
          material world, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg
          114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          although the Theory of Vision was the seminal principle of
          Berkeley's Theory of Matter<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280"
          href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Theory of
          Matter was imperfectly conceived and then rejected by Reid and his
          followers, while the New Theory of Vision obtained the general
          consent of the Scottish metaphysicians. Adam Smith refers to it in
          his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essays</span></span> (published in 1795) as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“one of the finest examples of
          philosophical analysis that is to be found either in our own or in
          any other language.”</span> Dugald Stewart characterises it in his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Elements</span></span> as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“one of the most beautiful, and at the same time one of
          the most important theories of modern philosophy.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The solid additions,”</span> he afterwards
          remarks in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dissertation</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“made by Berkeley to the stock of human knowledge, were
          important and brilliant. Among these the first place is
          unquestionably due to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">New Theory of Vision</span></span>, a work
          abounding with ideas so different from those commonly received, and
          at the same time so profound and refined, that it was regarded by
          all but a few accustomed to deep metaphysical reflection, rather in
          the light of a philosophical romance than of a sober inquiry after
          truth. Such, however, has since been the progress and diffusion of
          this sort of knowledge, that the leading and most abstracted
          doctrines contained in it form now an essential part of every
          elementary treatise on optics, and are adopted by the most
          superficial smatterers in science as fundamental articles of their
          faith.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">New Theory</span></span> is accepted by Thomas
          Brown, who proposes (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Lectures</span></span>, 29) to extend the
          scope of its reasonings. With regard to perceptions of sight,
          Young, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Lectures on Intellectual
          Philosophy</span></span> (p. 102), says that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it has been universally admitted, at least since the
          days of Berkeley, that many of those which appear to us at present
          to be instantaneous and primitive, can yet be shewn to be
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name=
          "Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> acquired; that most
          of the adult perceptions of sight are founded on the previous
          information of touch; that colour can give us no conception
          originally of those qualities of bodies which produce it in us; and
          that primary vision gives us no notion of distance, and, as I
          believe, no notion of magnitude.”</span> Sir James Mackintosh, in
          his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dissertation</span></span>, characterises the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New
          Theory of Vision</span></span> as <span class="tei tei-q">“a great
          discovery in Mental Philosophy.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nothing in the compass of inductive reasoning,”</span>
          remarks Sir William Hamilton (Reid's <span class=

          p. 182, note), <span class="tei tei-q">“appears more satisfactory
          than Berkeley's demonstration of the necessity and manner of our
          learning, by a slow process of observation and comparison alone,
          the connexion between the perceptions of vision and touch, and, in
          general, all that relates to the distance and magnitude of external
          things<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The New Theory
          of Vision has in short been generally accepted, so far as it was
          understood, alike by the followers of Hartley and by the associates
          and successors of Reid. Among British psychologists, it has
          recommended itself to rationalists and sensationalists, to the
          advocates of innate principles, and to those who would explain by
          accidental association what their opponents attribute to reason
          originally latent in man. But this wide conscious assent is I think
          chiefly confined to the proposition that distance is invisible, and
          hardly reaches the deeper implicates of the theory, on its
          extension to all the senses, leading to a perception of the final
          unity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name=

          without doing violence to myself, forbear upon this occasion to
          give some public testimony of the great and well-grounded esteem I
          have conceived for you, ever since I had the honour and happiness
          of your acquaintance. The outward advantages of fortune, and the
          early honours with which you are adorned, together with the
          reputation you are known to have amongst the best and most
          considerable men, may well imprint veneration and esteem on the
          minds of those who behold you from a distance. But these are not
          the chief motives that inspire me with the respect I bear you. A
          nearer approach has given me the view of something in your person
          infinitely beyond the external ornaments of honour and estate. I
          mean, an intrinsic stock of virtue and good sense, a true concern
          for religion, and disinterested love of your country. Add to these
          an uncommon proficiency in the best and most useful parts of
          knowledge; together with (what in my mind is <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a perfection of the first rank) a
          surpassing goodness of nature. All which I have collected, not from
          the uncertain reports of fame, but from my own experience. Within
          these few months that I have the honour to be known unto you, the
          many delightful hours I have passed in your agreeable and improving
          conversation have afforded me the opportunity of discovering in you
          many excellent qualities, which at once fill me with admiration and
          esteem. That one at those years, and in those circumstances of
          wealth and greatness, should continue proof against the charms of
          luxury and those criminal pleasures so fashionable and predominant
          in the age we live in; that he should preserve a sweet and modest
          behaviour, free from that insolent and assuming air so familiar to
          those who are placed above the ordinary rank of men; that he should
          manage a great fortune with that prudence and inspection, and at
          the same time expend it with that generosity and nobleness of mind,
          as to shew himself equally remote from a sordid parsimony and a
          lavish inconsiderate profusion of the good things he is intrusted
          with—this, surely, were admirable and praiseworthy. But, that he
          should, moreover, by an impartial exercise of his reason, and
          constant perusal of the sacred Scriptures, endeavour to attain a
          right notion of the principles of natural and revealed religion;
          that he should with the concern of a true patriot have the interest
          of the public at heart, and omit no means of informing himself what
          may be prejudicial or advantageous to his country, in order to
          prevent the one and promote the other; in fine, that, by a constant
          application to the most severe and useful studies, by a strict
          observation of the rules of honour and virtue, by frequent and
          serious reflections on the mistaken measures of the world, and the
          true end and happiness of mankind, he should in all respects
          qualify himself bravely to run the race that is set before him, to
          deserve the character of great and good in this life, and be ever
          happy hereafter—this were amazing and almost incredible. Yet all
          this, and more than this, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Sir</span></span>, might I justly say of
          you, did either your modesty permit, or your character stand in
          need of it. I know it might deservedly be thought a vanity in me to
          imagine that anything coming from so obscure a hand as mine could
          add a lustre to your reputation. But, I am withal sensible how

          interest of my own, by laying hold on this opportunity to make it
          known that I am admitted into some degree of intimacy with a person
          of your exquisite judgment. And, with that view, I have ventured to
          make you an address of this nature, which the goodness I have ever
          experienced in you inclines me to hope will meet with a favourable
          reception at your hands. Though I must own I have your pardon to
          ask, for touching on what may possibly be offensive to a virtue you
          are possessed of in a very distinguishing degree. Excuse me,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">Sir</span></span>, if it was out of my
          power to mention the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          paying some tribute to that extraordinary and surprising merit
          whereof I have so clear and affecting an idea, and which, I am
          sure, cannot be exposed in too full a light for the imitation of
          others,</p>

          fruit of that (labour shall I call it or) diversion is what I now
          present you with, in hopes it may give some entertainment to one
          who, in the midst of business and vulgar enjoyments, preserves a
          relish for the more refined pleasures of thought and reflexion. My

          prejudices that enslave the far greater part of mankind, may
          deservedly be thought a proper patron for an attempt of this kind.
          Add to this, that you are no less disposed to forgive than
          qualified to discern whatever faults may occur in it. Nor do I
          think <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name=

          and difficult things, so much as in a just confidence of your own
          abilities. And, in this one instance, give me leave to say, you
          shew a manifest weakness of judgment. With relation to the

          a line directed endwise to the eye, it projects only one point in

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. I find it
          also acknowledged that the estimate we make of the distance of
          objects considerably remote is rather an act of judgment grounded
          on experience than of sense. For example, when I perceive a great
          number of intermediate objects, such as houses, fields, rivers, and
          the like, which I have experienced to take up a considerable space,
          I thence form a judgment or conclusion, that the object I see
          beyond them is at a great distance. Again, when an object appears
          faint and small which at a near distance I have experienced to make
          a vigorous and large appearance, I instantly conclude it to be far
          off<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href=
          "#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>. And
          this, it is evident, is the result of experience; without which,
          from the faintness and littleness, I should not have inferred
          anything concerning the distance of objects.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. But, when an
          object is placed at so near a distance as that the interval between
          the eyes bears any sensible proportion to it<a id="noteref_291"
          name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a>, the
          opinion of speculative men is, that the two optic axes (the fancy
          that we see only with one eye at once being exploded), concurring
          at the object, do there make an angle, by means of which, according
          as it is greater or lesser, the object is perceived to be nearer or
          farther off<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href=
          "#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. Betwixt which
          and the foregoing manner of estimating distance there is this
          remarkable difference:—that, whereas there was no apparent
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> connexion between small
          distance and a large and strong appearance, or between great
          distance and a little and faint appearance, there <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> appears a very <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">necessary</span></em> connexion between an
          obtuse angle and near distance, and an acute angle and farther
          distance. It does not in the least depend upon experience, but may
          be evidently known by any one before he had experienced it, that
          the nearer the concurrence of the optic axes the greater the angle,
          and the remoter their concurrence is, the lesser will be the angle
          comprehended by them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">6. There is
          another way, mentioned by optic writers, whereby they will have us
          judge of those distances in respect of which the breadth of the
          pupil hath any sensible bigness. And that is the greater or lesser
          divergency of the rays which, issuing from the visible point, do
          fall on the pupil—that point being judged nearest which is seen by
          most diverging rays, and that remoter which is seen by less
          diverging rays, and so on; the apparent distance still increasing,
          as the divergency of the rays decreases, till at length it becomes
          infinite, when the rays that fall on the pupil are to sense
          parallel. And after this manner it is said we perceive distance
          when we look only with one eye.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. In this case
          also it is plain we are not beholden to experience: it being a
          certain necessary truth that, the nearer the direct rays falling on
          the eye approach to a parallelism, the farther off is the point of
          their intersection, or the visible point from whence they flow.</p>

          though the accounts here given of perceiving <em class=

          distance by sight are received for true, and accordingly made use
          of in determining the apparent places of objects, they do
          nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory, and that for these
          following reasons:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">9. [<em class=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a>,] It
          is evident that, when the mind perceives any idea not immediately
          and of itself, it must be by the means of some other idea. Thus,
          for instance, the passions which are in the mind of another are of
          themselves to me invisible. I may nevertheless perceive them
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name=
          "Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by sight; though not
          immediately, yet by means of the colours they produce in the
          countenance. We often see shame or fear in the looks of a man, by
          perceiving the changes of his countenance to red or pale.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">10. Moreover, it
          is evident that no idea which is not itself perceived can be to me
          the means of perceiving any other idea. If I do not perceive the
          redness or paleness of a man's face themselves, it is impossible I
          should perceive by them the passions which are in his mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">11. Now, from
          sect. ii., it is plain that distance is in its own nature
          imperceptible, and yet it is perceived by sight<a id="noteref_295"
          name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class=

          remains, therefore, that it be brought into view by means of some
          other idea, that is itself immediately perceived in the act of
          vision.</p>

          distance, are themselves not at all perceived; nor are they in
          truth ever thought of by those unskilful in optics. I appeal to any
          one's experience, whether, upon sight of an object, he computes its
          distance by the bigness of the angle made by the meeting of the two
          optic axes? or whether he ever thinks of the greater or lesser
          divergency of the rays which arrive from any point to his pupil?
          nay, whether it be not perfectly impossible for him to perceive by
          sense the various angles wherewith the rays, according to their
          greater or lesser divergence, do fall on the eye? Every one is
          himself the best judge of what he perceives, and what not. In vain
          shall any man<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href=

          me, that I perceive certain lines and angles, which introduce into
          my mind the various ideas of distance, so long as I myself am
          conscious of no such thing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">13. Since
          therefore those angles and lines are not themselves <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> perceived by sight, it follows, from
          sect. x., that the mind does not by them judge of the distance of
          objects.</p>

          truth of this assertion will be yet farther evident to any one that
          considers those lines and angles have no real existence in nature,
          being only an hypothesis framed by the mathematicians, and by them
          introduced into optics, that they might treat of that science in a

          reason I shall give for rejecting that doctrine is, that though we
          should grant the real existence of those optic angles, &amp;c., and
          that it was possible for the mind to perceive them, yet these

          the mind, by the mediation of some other idea which is itself
          perceived in the act of seeing, it remains that we inquire, what
          ideas or sensations there be that attend vision, unto which we may
          suppose the ideas of distance are connected, and by which they are

          it is certain by experience, that when we look at a near object
          with both eyes, according as it approaches or recedes from us, we
          alter the disposition of our eyes, by lessening or widening the
          interval between the pupils. This disposition or turn of the eyes
          is attended with a sensation<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303"
          href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>,
          which seems to me to be that which in this case brings the idea of
          greater or lesser distance into the mind.</p><span class=

          connexion between the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eyes
          and greater or lesser distance. But—because the mind has, by
          constant experience, found the different sensations corresponding
          to the different dispositions of the eyes to be attended each with
          a different degree of distance in the object—there has grown an
          habitual or customary connexion between those two sorts of ideas:
          so that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the
          different turn it gives the eyes, in order to bring the pupils
          nearer or farther asunder, but it withal perceives the different
          idea of distance which was wont to be connected with that
          sensation. Just as, upon hearing a certain sound, the idea is
          immediately suggested to the understanding which custom had united
          with it<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">18. Nor do I see
          how I can easily be mistaken in this matter. I know evidently that
          distance is not perceived of itself<a id="noteref_306" name=

          that, by consequence, it must be perceived by means of some other
          idea, which is immediately perceived, and varies with the different
          degrees of distance. I know also that the sensation arising from
          the turn of the eyes is of itself immediately perceived; and
          various degrees thereof are connected with different distances,
          which never fail to accompany them into my mind, when I view an
          object distinctly with both eyes whose distance is so small that in
          respect of it the interval between the eyes has any considerable
          magnitude.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">19. I know it is
          a received opinion that, by altering the disposition of the eyes,
          the mind perceives whether the angle of the optic axes, or the
          lateral angles comprehended between the interval of the eyes or the
          optic axes, are made greater or lesser; and that, accordingly, by a
          kind of natural geometry, it judges the point of their intersection
          to be nearer or farther off. But that this is not true I am

          experience; since I am not conscious that I make any such use of
          the perception I have by the turn of my eyes. And for me to make

          which it follows, that the judgment we make of the distance of an
          object viewed with both eyes is entirely the result of experience.
          If we had not constantly found certain sensations, arising from the
          various disposition of the eyes, attended with certain degrees of
          distance, we should never make those sudden judgments from them
          concerning the distance of objects; no more than we would pretend
          to judge of a man's thoughts by his pronouncing words we had never
          heard before.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">21. <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em>, an object placed at a
          certain distance from the eye, to which the breadth of the pupil
          bears a considerable proportion, being made to approach, is seen
          more confusedly<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href=
          "#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a>. And
          the nearer it is brought the more confused appearance it makes. And
          this being found constantly to be so, there arises in the mind an
          habitual connexion between the several degrees of confusion and
          distance; the greater confusion still implying the lesser distance,
          and the lesser confusion the greater distance of the object.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">22. This
          confused appearance of the object doth therefore seem to be the
          medium whereby the mind judges of distance, in those cases wherein
          the most approved writers of optics will have it judge by the
          different divergency with which the rays flowing from the radiating
          point fall on the pupil<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href=
          "#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a>. No
          man, I believe, will pretend to see or feel those imaginary angles
          that the rays are supposed to form, according to their various
          inclinations on his eye. But he cannot choose seeing whether the
          object appear more or less confused. It is therefore a manifest
          consequence from what has been demonstrated that, instead of the
          greater or lesser divergency of the rays, the mind makes use of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name=
          "Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> greater or lesser
          confusedness of the appearance, thereby to determine the apparent
          place of an object.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">23. Nor doth it
          avail to say there is not any necessary connexion between confused
          vision and distance great or small. For I ask any man what
          necessary connexion he sees between the redness of a blush and
          shame? And yet no sooner shall he behold that colour to arise in
          the face of another but it brings into his mind the idea of that
          passion which hath been observed to accompany it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">24. What seems
          to have misled the writers of optics in this matter is, that they
          imagine men judge of distance as they do of a conclusion in
          mathematics; betwixt which and the premises it is indeed absolutely
          requisite there be an apparent necessary connexion. But it is far
          otherwise in the sudden judgments men make of distance. We are not
          to think that brutes and children, or even grown reasonable men,
          whenever they perceive an object to approach or depart from them,
          do it by virtue of geometry and demonstration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">25. That one
          idea may suggest another to the mind, it will suffice that they
          have been observed to go together, without any demonstration of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">necessity</span></em> of their coexistence, or
          without so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to
          coexist. Of this there are innumerable instances, of which no one
          can be ignorant<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href=
          "#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">26. Thus,
          greater confusion having been constantly attended with nearer
          distance, no sooner is the former idea perceived but it suggests
          the latter to our thoughts. And, if it had been the ordinary course
          of nature that the farther off an object were placed the more
          confused it should appear, it is certain the very same perception
          that now makes us think an object approaches would then have made
          us to imagine it went farther off; that perception, abstracting
          from custom and experience, being equally fitted to produce the
          idea of great distance, or small distance, or no distance at
          all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">27. <em class=

          "font-style: italic">Thirdly</span></em>, an object being placed at
          the distance above specified, and brought nearer to the eye, we may
          nevertheless prevent, at least for some time, the appearance's
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name=

          which case that sensation supplies the place of confused vision, in
          aiding the mind to judge of the distance of the object; it being
          esteemed so much the nearer by how much the effort or straining of
          the eye in order to distinct vision is greater.</p>

          seem to be the constant and general occasions of introducing into

          cases, that divers other circumstances contribute to frame our idea
          of distance, viz. the particular number, size, kind, &amp;c. of the
          things seen. Concerning which, as well as all other the
          forementioned occasions which suggest distance, I shall only
          observe, they have none of them, in their own nature, any relation
          or connexion with it: nor is it possible they should ever signify
          the various degrees thereof, otherwise than as by experience they
          have been found to be connected with them.</p>

            this subject. But, before I quit it for good and all, the fair
            and ingenuous dealing that I owe both to you and to truth obliges
            me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty, which
            seems directly opposite to the doctrine I have been hitherto
            inculcating, at least admits of no solution from it. In short it
            is this. Before the double convex glass or concave

            that it would appear before the eye at a vast distance off, so
            great as should in some sort surpass all sensible distance. For
            since, if we exclude all anticipations and prejudices, every
            object appears by so much the farther off by how much the rays it
            sends to the eye are less diverging; and that object is thought
            to be most remote from which parallel rays proceed unto the eye;
            reason would make one think that object should appear at yet a
            greater distance which is seen by converging rays. Moreover, it
            may in general be asked concerning this case, what it is that
            determines the apparent place of the point</span> <span class=

            the contrary, we are assured by experience, that the point</span>

            farther off than it would if it were beheld by the naked eye;
            but, on the contrary, it doth sometimes appear much nearer. Nay,
            it is even certain that by how much the rays falling on the eye

            by it. The ancient one especially (which is most commonly
            received, and comes nearest to mine) seems to be so effectually
            overthrown thereby that the most learned Tacquet has been forced
            to reject that principle, as false and uncertain, on which alone
            he had built almost his whole</span> <span class=

            and consequently, by taking away the foundation, hath himself
            pulled down the superstructure he had raised on it. Which,
            nevertheless, I do not believe he would have done, had he but
            considered the whole matter more thoroughly, and examined the
            difficulty to the bottom. But as for me, neither this nor any
            other difficulty shall have so great an influence on me, as to
            make me renounce that which I know to be manifestly agreeable to
            reason. Especially when, as it here falls out, the difficulty is
            founded in the peculiar nature of a certain odd and particular
            case. For, in the present case something peculiar lies hid,
            which, being involved in the subtilty of nature, will perhaps

          ray and the perpendicular of incidence.”</span> Which intersection
          in the present case happening to be behind the eye, it greatly
          shakes the authority of that principle whereon the aforementioned

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">31. Let us now
          see how this phenomenon agrees with our tenets<a id="noteref_317"

          the above figures, the more distinct is the appearance of the
          object: but, as it recedes to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          confused; and at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">P</span></span> it sees the object yet more
          confused; and so on, till the eye, being brought back to
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Z</span></span>, sees the object in the
          greatest confusion of all. Wherefore, by sect. 21, the object
          should seem to approach the eye gradually, as it recedes from the
          point <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">B</span></span>; that is, at <span class=

          should (in consequence of the principle I have laid down in the

          so on, till it quite vanishes at <span class=

          Which is the very matter of fact, as any one that pleases may
          easily satisfy himself by experiment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">32. This case is
          much the same as if we should suppose an Englishman to meet a
          foreigner who used the same words with the English, but in a direct
          contrary <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg

          signification. The Englishman would not fail to make a wrong
          judgment of the ideas annexed to those sounds, in the mind of him
          that used them. Just so in the present case, the object speaks (if
          I may so say) with words that the eye is well acquainted with, that
          is, confusions of appearance; but, whereas heretofore the greatest
          confusions were always wont to signify nearer distances, they have
          in this case a direct contrary signification, being connected with
          the greater distances. Whence it follows that the eye must
          unavoidably be mistaken, since it will take the confusions in the
          sense it has been used to, which is directly opposed to the
          true.</p>

          phenomenon, as it entirely subverts the opinion of those who will
          have us judge of distance by lines and angles, on which supposition
          it is altogether inexplicable, so it seems to me no small
          confirmation of the truth of that principle whereby it is

          in order to a more full explication of this point, and to shew how
          far the hypothesis of the mind's judging by the various divergency
          of rays may be of use in determining the apparent place of an
          object, it will be necessary to premise some few things, which are
          already well known to those who have any skill in Dioptrics.</p>

          Any radiating point is then distinctly seen when the rays
          proceeding from it are, by the refractive power of the crystalline,
          accurately reunited in the retina or fund of the eye. But if they
          are reunited either before they arrive at the retina, or after they
          have passed it, then there is confused vision.</p>

          "font-style: italic">NP</span></span> represent an eye duly framed,
          and retaining its natural figure. In fig. 1 the rays falling nearly
          parallel on the eye, are, by the crystalline <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">AB</span></span>,
          refracted, so as their focus, or point of union <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">F</span></span>,
          falls exactly on the retina. But, if the rays fall sensibly
          diverging on the eye, as in fig. 2, then their focus falls beyond
          the retina; or, if the rays are made to converge by the lens
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          as in fig. 3, their focus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">F</span></span> will fall before the retina.
          In which two last cases it is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          appearance of the point <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the greater is the convergency or divergency of the rays falling on
          the pupil, by so much the farther will the point of their reunion
          be from the retina, either before or behind it, and consequently
          the point <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Z</span></span> will appear by so much the
          more confused. And this, by the bye, may shew us the difference
          between confused and faint vision. Confused vision is, when the
          rays proceeding from each distinct point of the object are not
          accurately re-collected in one corresponding point on the retina,
          but take up some space thereon—so that rays from different points
          become mixed and confused together. This is opposed to a distinct
          vision, and attends near objects. Faint vision is when, by reason
          of the distance of the object, or grossness of the interjacent
          medium, few rays arrive from the object to the eye. <span class=

          (to speak truly) the mind, perceiving only the confusion itself,
          without ever considering the cause from which it proceeds, doth
          constantly annex the same degree of distance to the same degree of
          confusion. Whether that confusion be occasioned by converging or by
          diverging rays it matters not. Whence it follows that the eye,
          viewing the object <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Z</span></span> through the glass <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">QS</span></span>
          (which by refraction causeth the rays <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ZQ</span></span>,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ZS</span></span>, &amp;c. to converge), should
          judge it to be at such a nearness, at which, if it were placed, it
          would radiate on the eye, with rays diverging to that degree as
          would produce the same confusion which is now produced by
          converging rays, i.e. would cover a portion of the retina equal to
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">DC.</span></span> (Vid. fig. 3, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sup.</span></span>)
          But then this must be understood (to use Dr. Barrow's phrase)
          <span class="tei tei-q">“seclusis prænotionibus et
          præjudiciis,”</span> in case we abstract from all other
          circumstances of vision, such as the figure, size, faintness,
          &amp;c. of the visible objects—all which do ordinarily concur to
          form our idea of distance, the mind having, by frequent experience,
          observed their several sorts or degrees to be connected with
          various distances.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">37. It plainly
          follows from what has been said, that a person perfectly purblind
          (i.e. that could not see an object distinctly but when placed close
          to his eye) would not make the same wrong judgment that others do
          in the forementioned case. For, to him, greater confusions
          constantly suggesting greater distances, he must, as he recedes
          from the glass, and the object grows more confused, judge it to be
          at a farther distance; contrary to what they do who have had the
          perception of the objects growing more confused connected with the
          idea of approach.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">38. Hence also
          it doth appear, there may be good use of computation, by lines and
          angles, in optics<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href=
          "#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a>; not
          that the mind judges of distance immediately by them, but because
          it judges by somewhat which is connected with them, and to the
          determination whereof they may be subservient. Thus, the mind
          judging of the distance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
          144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of an object by the confusedness of its appearance, and this
          confusedness being greater or lesser to the naked eye, according as
          the object is seen by rays more or less diverging, it follows that
          a man may make use of the divergency of the rays, in computing the
          apparent distance, though not for its own sake, yet on account of
          the confusion with which it is connected. But so it is, the
          confusion itself is entirely neglected by mathematicians, as having
          no necessary relation with distance, such as the greater or lesser
          angles of divergency are conceived to have. And these (especially
          for that they fall under mathematical computation) are alone
          regarded, in determining the apparent places of objects, as though
          they were the sole and immediate cause of the judgments the mind
          makes of distance. Whereas, in truth, they should not at all be
          regarded in themselves, or any otherwise than as they are supposed
          to be the cause of confused vision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">39. The not
          considering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing
          oversight. For proof whereof, we need go no farther than the case
          before us. It having been observed that the most diverging rays
          brought into the mind the idea of nearest distance, and that still
          as the divergency decreased the distance increased, and it being
          thought the connexion between the various degrees of divergency and
          distance was immediate—this naturally leads one to conclude, from
          an ill-grounded analogy, that converging rays shall make an object
          appear at an immense distance, and that, as the convergency
          increases, the distance (if it were possible) should do so
          likewise. That this was the cause of Dr. Barrow's mistake is
          evident from his own words which we have quoted. Whereas had the
          learned Doctor observed that diverging and converging rays, how
          opposite soever they may seem, do nevertheless agree in producing
          the same effect, to wit, confusedness of vision, greater degrees
          whereof are produced indifferently, either as the divergency or
          convergency of the rays increaseth; and that it is by this effect,
          which is the same in both, that either the divergency or
          convergency is perceived by the eye—I say, had he but considered
          this, it is certain he would have made a quite contrary judgment,
          and rightly concluded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg
          145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that those rays which fall on the eye with greater degrees of
          convergency should make the object from whence they proceed appear
          by so much the nearer. But it is plain it was impossible for any
          man to attain to a right notion of this matter so long as he had
          regard only to lines and angles, and did not apprehend the true
          nature of vision, and how far it was of mathematical
          consideration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">40. Before we
          dismiss this subject, it is fit we take notice of a query relating
          thereto, proposed by the ingenious Mr. Molyneux, in his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Treatise
          of Dioptrics</span></span> (par. i. prop. 31. sect. 9), where,
          speaking of the difficulty we have been explaining, he has these
          words: <span class="tei tei-q">“And so he (i.e. Dr. Barrow) leaves
          this difficulty to the solution of others, which I (after so great
          an example) shall do likewise; but with the resolution of the same
          admirable author, of not quitting the evident doctrine which we
          have before laid down, for determining the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">locus objecti</span></span>, on account of
          being pressed by one difficulty, which seems inexplicable till a
          more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtained by
          mortals. In the meantime I propose it to the consideration of the
          ingenious, whether the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">locus
          apparens</span></span> of an object placed as in this ninth section
          be not as much before the eye as the distinct base is behind the
          eye?”</span> To which query we may venture to answer in the
          negative. For, in the present case, the rule for determining the
          distance of the distinct base, or respective focus from the glass
          is this: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">As the difference between the distance of the
          object and focus is to the focus or focal length, so the distance
          of the object from the glass is to the distance of the respective
          focus or distinct base from the glass.</span></em> (Molyneux,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dioptr.</span></span>, par. i. prop. 5.) Let
          us now suppose the object to be placed at the distance of the focal
          length, and one-half of the focal length from the glass, and the
          eye close to the glass. Hence it will follow, by the rule, that the
          distance of the distinct base behind the eye is double the true
          distance of the object before the eye. If, therefore, Mr.
          Molyneux's conjecture held good, it would follow that the eye
          should see the object twice as far off as it really is; and in
          other cases at three or four times its due distance, or more. But
          this manifestly contradicts experience, the object never appearing,
          at farthest, beyond its due distance. Whatever, therefore, is built
          on this supposition <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg
          146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          (vid. corol. i. prop. 57. ibid.) comes to the ground along with
          it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">41. From what
          hath been premised, it is a manifest consequence, that a man born
          blind, being made to see, would at first have no idea of distance
          by sight: the sun and stars, the remotest objects as well as the
          nearer, would all seem to be in his eye, or rather in his mind. The
          objects intromitted by sight would seem to him (as in truth they
          are) no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations, each
          whereof is as near to him as the perceptions of pain or pleasure,
          or the most inward passions of his soul. For, our judging objects
          perceived by sight to be at any distance, or without the mind, is
          (vid. sect, xxviii.) entirely the effect of experience; which one
          in those circumstances could not yet have attained to<a id=
          "noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">42. It is indeed
          otherwise upon the common supposition—that men judge of distance by
          the angle of the optic axes, just as one in the dark, or a blind
          man by the angle comprehended by two sticks, one whereof he held in
          each hand<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href=
          "#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a>. For,
          if this were true, it would follow that one blind from his birth,
          being made to see, should stand in need of no new experience, in
          order to perceive distance by sight. But that this is false has, I
          think, been sufficiently demonstrated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">43. And perhaps,
          upon a strict inquiry, we shall not find that even those who from
          their birth have grown up in a continued habit of seeing are
          irrecoverably prejudiced on the other side, to wit, in thinking
          what they see to be at a distance from them. For, at this time it
          seems agreed on all hands, by those who have had any thoughts of
          that matter, that colours, which are the proper and immediate
          object of sight, are not without the mind.—But then, it will be
          said, by sight we have also the ideas of extension, and figure, and
          motion; all which may well be thought without and at some distance
          from the mind, though colour should <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> not. In answer to this, I appeal to any man's
          experience, whether the visible extension of any object do not
          appear as near to him as the colour of that object; nay, whether
          they do not both seem to be in the very same place. Is not the
          extension we see coloured, and is it possible for us, so much as in
          thought, to separate and abstract colour from extension? Now, where
          the extension is, there surely is the figure, and there the motion
          too. I speak of those which are perceived by sight<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">44. But for a
          fuller explication of this point, and to shew that the immediate
          objects of sight are not so much as the ideas or resemblances of
          things placed at a distance, it is requisite that we look nearer
          into the matter, and carefully observe what is meant in common
          discourse when one says, that which he sees is at a distance from
          him. Suppose, for example, that looking at the moon I should say it
          were fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me. Let
          us see what moon this is spoken of. It is plain it cannot be the
          visible moon, or anything like the visible moon, or that which I
          see—which is only a round luminous plain, of about thirty visible
          points in diameter. For, in case I am carried from the place where
          I stand directly towards the moon, it is manifest the object varies
          still as I go on; and, by the time that I am advanced fifty or
          sixty semidiameters of the earth, I shall be so far from being near
          a small, round, luminous flat that I shall perceive nothing like
          it—this object having long since disappeared, and, if I would
          recover it, it must be by going back to the earth from whence I set
          out<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href=
          "#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a>.
          Again, suppose I perceive by sight the faint and obscure idea of
          something, which I doubt whether it be a man, or a tree, or a
          tower, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg
          148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          judge it to be at the distance of about a mile. It is plain I
          cannot mean that what I see is a mile off, or that it is the image
          or likeness of anything which is a mile off; since that every step
          I take towards it the appearance alters, and from being obscure,
          small, and faint, grows clear, large, and vigorous. And when I come
          to the mile's end, that which I saw first is quite lost, neither do
          I find anything in the likeness of it<a id="noteref_324" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">45. In these and
          the like instances, the truth of the matter, I find, stands
          thus:—Having of a long time experienced certain ideas perceivable
          by touch<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href=
          "#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>—as
          distance, tangible figure, and solidity—to have been connected with
          certain ideas of sight, I do, upon perceiving these ideas of sight,
          forthwith conclude what tangible ideas are, by the wonted ordinary
          course of nature, like to follow. Looking at an object, I perceive
          a certain visible figure and colour, with some degree of faintness
          and other circumstances, which, from what I have formerly observed,
          determine me to think that if I advance forward so many paces,
          miles, &amp;c., I shall be affected with such and such ideas of
          touch. So that, in truth and strictness of speech, I neither see
          distance itself, nor anything that I take to be at a distance. I
          say, neither distance nor things placed at a distance are
          themselves, or their ideas, truly perceived by sight. This I am
          persuaded of, as to what concerns myself. And I believe whoever
          will look narrowly into his own thoughts, and examine what he means
          by saying he sees this or that thing at a distance, will agree with
          me, that what he sees <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
          149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          only suggests to his understanding that, after having passed a
          certain distance, to be measured by the motion of his body, which
          is perceivable by touch<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href=

          shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas, which have
          been usually connected with such and such visible ideas. But, that
          one might be deceived by these suggestions of sense, and that there
          is no necessary connexion between visible and tangible ideas
          suggested by them, we need go no farther than the next
          looking-glass or picture to be convinced. Note that, when I speak
          of tangible ideas, I take the word idea for any the immediate
          object of sense, or understanding—in which large signification it
          is commonly used by the moderns<a id="noteref_327" name=

          are not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear. Sitting in
          my study I hear a coach drive along the street; I look through the
          casement and see it; I walk out and enter into it. Thus, common
          speech would incline one to think I heard, saw, and touched the
          same thing, to wit, the coach. It is nevertheless certain the ideas
          intromitted by each sense are widely different, and distinct from
          each other; but, having been observed constantly to go together,
          they are spoken of as one and the same thing. By the variation of
          the noise, I perceive the different distances of the coach, and
          know that it approaches before I look out. Thus, by the ear I
          perceive distance just after the same manner as I do by the
          eye.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">47. I do not

          ideas of touch as those of sight are. So likewise a man is easily
          convinced that bodies and external things are not properly the
          object of hearing, but only sounds, by the mediation whereof the
          idea of this or that body, or distance, is suggested to his

          than he hears and feels the same thing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">48. One reason
          of which seems to be this. It is thought a great absurdity to
          imagine that one and the same thing should have any more than one
          extension and one figure. But, the extension and figure of a body
          being let into the mind two ways, and that indifferently, either by
          sight or touch, it seems to follow that we see the same extension
          and the same figure which we feel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">49. But, if we
          take a close and accurate view of the matter, it must be
          acknowledged that we never see and feel one and the same
          object<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href=

          which is seen is one thing, and that which is felt is another. If
          the visible figure and extension be not the same with the tangible
          figure and extension, we are not to infer that one and the same
          thing has divers extensions. The true consequence is that the
          objects of sight and touch are two distinct things<a id=

          may perhaps require some thought rightly to conceive this
          distinction. And the difficulty seems not a little increased,
          because the combination of visible ideas hath constantly the same
          name as the combination of tangible ideas wherewith it is
          connected—which doth of necessity arise from the use and end of
          language<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href=

          therefore, to treat accurately and unconfusedly of vision, we must
          bear in mind that there are two sorts of objects apprehended by the
          eye—the one primarily and immediately, the other secondarily and by
          intervention of the former. Those of the first sort neither are nor
          appear to be without the mind, or at any distance off<a id=

          grow greater or smaller, more confused, or more clear, or more

          recede from us. Whenever we say an object is at a distance,
          whenever we say it draws near, or goes farther off, we must always
          mean it of the latter sort, which properly belong to the
          touch<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href=

          are not so truly perceived as suggested by the eye, in like manner
          as thoughts by the ear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">51. No sooner do
          we hear the words of a familiar language pronounced in our ears but
          the ideas corresponding thereto present themselves to our minds: in
          the very same instant the sound and the meaning enter the
          understanding: so closely are they united that it is not in our
          power to keep out the one except we exclude the other also. We even
          act in all respects as if we heard the very thoughts themselves. So
          likewise the secondary objects, or those which are only suggested
          by sight, do often more strongly affect us, and are more regarded,
          than the proper objects of that sense; along with which they enter
          into the mind, and with which they have a far more strict connexion
          than ideas have with words<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337"

          Hence it is we find it so difficult to discriminate between the
          immediate and mediate objects of sight, and are so prone to
          attribute to the former what belongs only to the latter. They are,
          as it were, most closely twisted, blended, and incorporated
          together. And the prejudice is confirmed and riveted in our
          thoughts by a long tract of time, by the use of language, and want
          of reflection. However, I doubt not but anyone that shall
          attentively consider what we have already said, and shall say upon
          this subject before we have done (especially if he pursue it in his
          own thoughts), may be able to deliver himself from that prejudice.

          follows that, as we have shewn lines and angles not to be the
          medium the mind makes use of in apprehending the apparent place, so
          neither are they the medium whereby it apprehends the apparent
          magnitude of objects.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">53. It is well
          known that the same extension at a near distance shall subtend a
          greater angle, and at a farther distance a lesser angle. And by
          this principle (we are told) the mind estimates the magnitude of an

          comparing the angle under which it is seen with its distance, and
          thence inferring the magnitude thereof. What inclines men to this
          mistake (beside the humour of making one see by geometry) is, that
          the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance do also
          suggest magnitude. But, if we examine it, we shall find they
          suggest the latter as immediately as the former. I say, they do not
          first suggest distance and then leave it to the judgment to use
          that as a medium whereby to collect the magnitude; but they have as
          close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the
          distance; and suggest magnitude as independently of distance, as
          they do distance independently of magnitude. All which will be
          evident to whoever considers what has been already said and what
          follows.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">54. It has been
          shewn there are two sorts of objects apprehended by sight, each
          whereof has its distinct magnitude, or extension—the one, properly
          tangible, i.e. to be perceived and measured by touch, and not
          immediately falling under the sense of seeing; the other, properly
          and immediately visible, by mediation of which the former is

          magnitude of the object which exists without the mind, and is at a
          distance, continues always invariably the same: but, the visible
          object still changing as you approach to or recede from the
          tangible object, it hath no fixed and determinate greatness.
          Whenever therefore we speak of the magnitude of any thing, for
          instance a tree or a house, we must mean the tangible magnitude;
          otherwise there can be nothing steady and free from ambiguity
          spoken of it<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href=

          avoid tediousness and singularity of speech, sometimes speak of
          them as belonging to one and the same thing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">56. Now, in
          order to discover by what means the magnitude of tangible objects
          is perceived by sight, I need only reflect on what passes in my own
          mind, and observe what those things be which introduce the ideas of
          greater or lesser into my thoughts when I look on any object. And
          these I find to be, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">first</span></em>, the magnitude or extension
          of the visible object, which, being immediately perceived by sight,
          is connected with that other which is tangible and placed at a
          distance: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">secondly</span></em>, the confusion or
          distinctness: and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">thirdly</span></em>, the vigorousness or
          faintness of the aforesaid <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> visible appearance. <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cæteris paribus</span></span>, by how much the
          greater or lesser the visible object is, by so much the greater or
          lesser do I conclude the tangible object to be. But, be the idea
          immediately perceived by sight never so large, yet, if it be withal
          confused, I judge the magnitude of the thing to be but small. If it
          be distinct and clear, I judge it greater. And, if it be faint, I
          apprehend it to be yet greater. What is here meant by confusion and
          faintness has been explained in sect. 35.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">57. Moreover,
          the judgments we make of greatness do, in like manner as those of
          distance, depend on the disposition of the eye; also on the figure,
          number, and situation<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href=
          "#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a> of
          intermediate objects, and other circumstances that have been
          observed to attend great or small tangible magnitudes. Thus, for
          instance, the very same quantity of visible extension which in the
          figure of a tower doth suggest the idea of great magnitude shall in
          the figure of a man suggest the idea of much smaller magnitude.
          That this is owing to the experience we have had of the usual
          bigness of a tower and a man, no one, I suppose, need be told.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">58. It is also
          evident that confusion or faintness have no more a necessary
          connexion with little or great magnitude than they have with little
          or great distance. As they suggest the latter, so they suggest the
          former to our minds. And, by consequence, if it were not for
          experience, we should no more judge a faint or confused appearance
          to be connected with great or little magnitude than we should that
          it was connected with great or little distance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">59. Nor will it
          be found that great or small visible magnitude hath any necessary
          relation to great or small tangible magnitude—so that the one may
          certainly and infallibly be inferred from the other. But, before we
          come to the proof of this, it is fit we consider the difference
          there is betwixt the extension and figure which is the proper
          object of touch, and that other which is termed visible; and how
          the former is principally, though not immediately, taken notice of
          when we look at any object. This has been before mentioned<a id=
          "noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a>, but
          we shall here inquire into the cause thereof. We regard the objects
          that environ us in proportion as they are adapted to benefit or
          injure our own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg
          155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          bodies, and thereby produce in our minds the sensations of pleasure
          or pain. Now, bodies operating on our organs by an immediate
          application, and the hurt and advantage arising therefrom depending
          altogether on the tangible, and not at all on the visible,
          qualities of any object—this is a plain reason why those should be
          regarded by us much more than these. And for this end
          [chiefly<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href=
          "#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a>] the
          visive sense seems to have been bestowed on animals, to wit, that,
          by the perception of visible ideas (which in themselves are not
          capable of affecting or anywise altering the frame of their
          bodies), they may be able to foresee<a id="noteref_350" name=
          "noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> (from
          the experience they have had what tangible ideas are connected with
          such and such visible ideas) the damage or benefit which is like to
          ensue upon the application of their own bodies to this or that body
          which is at a distance. Which foresight, how necessary it is to the
          preservation of an animal, every one's experience can inform him.
          Hence it is that, when we look at an object, the tangible figure
          and extension thereof are principally attended to; whilst there is
          small heed taken of the visible figure and magnitude, which, though
          more immediately perceived, do less sensibly affect us, and are not
          fitted to produce any alteration in our bodies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">60. That the
          matter of fact is true will be evident to any one who considers
          that a man placed at ten foot distance is thought as great as if he
          were placed at the distance only of five foot; which is true, not
          with relation to the visible, but tangible greatness of the object:
          the visible magnitude being far greater at one station than it is
          at the other.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">61. Inches,
          feet, &amp;c. are settled, stated lengths, whereby we measure
          objects and estimate their magnitude. We say, for example, an
          object appears to be six inches, or six foot long. Now, that this
          cannot be meant of visible inches, &amp;c. is evident, because a
          visible inch is itself no constant determinate magnitude<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          cannot therefore serve to mark out and determine the magnitude of
          any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name=
          "Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> other thing. Take an
          inch marked upon a ruler; view it successively, at the distance of
          half a foot, a foot, a foot and a half, &amp;c. from the eye: at
          each of which, and at all the intermediate distances, the inch
          shall have a different visible extension, i.e. there shall be more
          or fewer points discerned in it. Now, I ask which of all these
          various extensions is that stated determinate one that is agreed on
          for a common measure of other magnitudes? No reason can be assigned
          why we should pitch on one more than another. And, except there be
          some invariable determinate extension fixed on to be marked by the
          word inch, it is plain it can be used to little purpose; and to say
          a thing contains this or that number of inches shall imply no more
          than that it is extended, without bringing any particular idea of
          that extension into the mind. Farther, an inch and a foot, from
          different distances, shall both exhibit the same visible magnitude,
          and yet at the same time you shall say that one seems several times
          greater than the other. From all which it is manifest, that the
          judgments we make of the magnitude of objects by sight are
          altogether in reference to their tangible extension. Whenever we
          say an object is great or small, of this or that determinate
          measure, I say, it must be meant of the tangible and not the
          visible extension<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href=
          "#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          which, though immediately perceived, is nevertheless little taken
          notice of.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">62. Now, that
          there is no necessary connexion between these two distinct
          extensions is evident from hence—because our eyes might have been
          framed in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what were
          less than the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">minimum
          tangibile</span></span>. In which case it is not impossible we
          might have perceived all the immediate objects of sight the very
          same that we do now; but unto those visible appearances there would
          not be connected those different tangible magnitudes that are now.
          Which shews the judgments we make of the magnitude of things placed
          at a distance, from the various greatness of the immediate objects
          of sight, do not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg

          arise from any essential or necessary, but only a customary, tie
          which has been observed betwixt them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">63. Moreover, it
          is not only certain that any idea of sight might not have been
          connected with this or that idea of touch we now observe to
          accompany it, but also that the greater visible magnitudes might
          have been connected with and introduced into our minds lesser
          tangible magnitudes, and the lesser visible magnitudes greater
          tangible magnitudes. Nay, that it actually is so, we have daily
          experience—that object which makes a strong and large appearance
          not seeming near so great as another the visible magnitude whereof
          is much less, but more faint,<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353"
          href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          the appearance upper, or which is the same thing, painted lower on
          the retina, which faintness and situation suggest both greater
          magnitude and greater distance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">64. From which,
          and from sect. 57 and 58, it is manifest that, as we do not
          perceive the magnitude of objects immediately by sight, so neither
          do we perceive them by the mediation of anything which has a
          necessary connexion with them. Those ideas that now suggest unto us
          the various magnitudes of external objects before we touch them
          might possibly have suggested no such thing; or they might have
          signified them in a direct contrary manner, so that the very same
          ideas on the perception whereof we judge an object to be small
          might as well have served to make us conclude it great;—those ideas
          being in their own nature equally fitted to bring into our minds
          the idea of small or great, or no size at all, of outward
          objects<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href=
          "#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a>, just
          as the words of any language are in their own nature indifferent to
          signify this or that thing, or nothing at all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">65. As we see
          distance so we see magnitude. And we see both in the same way that
          we see shame or anger in the looks of a man. Those passions are
          themselves invisible; they are nevertheless let in by the eye along
          with colours and alterations of countenance which are the immediate
          object of vision, and which signify them for no other reason than
          barely because they have been observed to accompany them. Without
          which experience we should <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          shame than of gladness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">66. We are
          nevertheless exceedingly prone to imagine those things which are
          perceived only by the mediation of others to be themselves the
          immediate objects of sight, or at least to have in their own nature
          a fitness to be suggested by them before ever they had been
          experienced to coexist with them. From which prejudice every one
          perhaps will not find it easy to emancipate himself, by any the
          clearest convictions of reason. And there are some grounds to think
          that, if there was one only invariable and universal language in
          the world, and that men were born with the faculty of speaking it,
          it would be the opinion of some, that the ideas in other men's
          minds were properly perceived by the ear, or had at least a
          necessary and inseparable tie with the sounds that were affixed to
          them. All which seems to arise from want of a due application of
          our discerning faculty, thereby to discriminate between the ideas
          that are in our understandings, and consider them apart from each
          other; which would preserve us from confounding those that are
          different, and make us see what ideas do, and what do not, include

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">67. There is a
          celebrated phenomenon<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href=
          "#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> the
          solution whereof I shall attempt to give, by the principles that
          have been laid down, in reference to the manner wherein we
          apprehend by sight the magnitude of objects.—The apparent magnitude
          of the moon, when placed in the horizon, is much greater than when
          it is in the meridian, though the angle under which the diameter of
          the moon is seen be not observed greater in the former case than in
          the latter; and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg
          159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the horizontal moon doth not constantly appear of the same bigness,
          but at some times seemeth far greater than at others.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">68. Now, in
          order to explain the reason of the moon's appearing greater than
          ordinary in the horizon, it must be observed that the particles
          which compose our atmosphere do intercept the rays of light
          proceeding from any object to the eye; and, by how much the greater
          is the portion of atmosphere interjacent between the object and the
          eye, by so much the more are the rays intercepted, and, by
          consequence, the appearance of the object rendered more faint—every
          object appearing more vigorous or more faint in proportion as it
          sendeth more or fewer rays into the eye. Now, between the eye and
          the moon when situated in the horizon there lies a far greater
          quantity of atmosphere than there does when the moon is in the
          meridian. Whence it comes to pass, that the appearance of the
          horizontal moon is fainter, and therefore, by sect. 56, it should
          be thought bigger in that situation than in the meridian, or in any
          other elevation above the horizon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">69. Farther, the
          air being variously impregnated, sometimes more and sometimes less,
          with vapours and exhalations fitted to retund and intercept the
          rays of light, it follows that the appearance of the horizontal
          moon hath not always an equal faintness, and, by consequence, that
          luminary, though in the very same situation, is at one time judged
          greater than at another.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">70. That we have
          here given the true account of the phenomena of the horizontal
          moon, will, I suppose, be farther evident to any one from the
          following considerations:—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">First</span></em>, it is plain, that which in
          this case suggests the idea of greater magnitude, must be something
          which is itself perceived; for, that which is unperceived cannot
          suggest to our perception any other thing<a id="noteref_357" name=
          "noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em>, it must be something
          that does not constantly remain the same, but is subject to some
          change or variation; since the appearance of the horizontal moon
          varies, being at one time greater than at another. [<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Thirdly</span></em>, it must not lie in the
          circumjacent or intermediate objects, such as mountains, houses,
          fields, &amp;c.; because that when all those objects are
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name=
          "Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> excluded from sight
          the appearance is as great as ever<a id="noteref_358" name=

          cannot be the visible figure or magnitude; since that remains the
          same, or is rather lesser, by how much the moon is nearer to the
          horizon. It remains therefore, that the true cause is that
          affection or alteration of the visible appearance, which proceeds
          from the greater paucity of rays arriving at the eye, and which I
          term faintness: since this answers all the forementioned
          conditions, and I am not conscious of any other perception that
          does.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">71. Add to this
          that in misty weather it is a common observation, that the
          appearance of the horizontal moon is far larger than usual, which
          greatly conspires with and strengthens our opinion. Neither would
          it prove in the least irreconcilable with what we have said, if the
          horizontal moon should chance sometimes to seem enlarged beyond its
          usual extent, even in more serene weather. For, we must not only
          have regard to the mist which happens to be in the place where we
          stand; we ought also to take into our thoughts the whole sum of
          vapours and exhalations which lie betwixt the eye and the moon: all
          which co-operating to render the appearance of the moon more faint,
          and thereby increase its magnitude, it may chance to appear greater
          than it usually does even in the horizontal position, at a time
          when, though there be no extraordinary fog or haziness just in the
          place where we stand, yet the air between the eye and the moon,
          taken altogether, may be loaded with a greater quantity of
          interspersed vapours and exhalations than at other times<a id=
          "noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href="#note_360"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">72. It may be
          objected that, in consequence of our principles, the interposition
          of a body in some degree opaque, which may intercept a great part
          of the rays of light, should render the appearance of the moon in
          the meridian as large as when it is viewed in the horizon. To which
          I answer, it is not faintness anyhow applied that suggests
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name=
          "Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> greater magnitude;
          there being no necessary, but only an experimental, connexion
          between those two things. It follows that the faintness which
          enlarges the appearance must be applied in such sort, and with such
          circumstances, as have been observed to attend the vision of great
          magnitudes. When from a distance we behold great objects, the
          particles of the intermediate air and vapours, which are themselves
          unperceivable, do interrupt the rays of light, and thereby render
          the appearance less strong and vivid. Now, faintness of appearance,
          caused in this sort, hath been experienced to co-exist with great
          magnitude. But when it is caused by the interposition of an opaque
          sensible body, this circumstance alters the case; so that a faint
          appearance this way caused does not suggest greater magnitude,
          because it hath not been experienced to co-exist with it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">73. Faintness,
          as well as all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude
          or distance, does it in the same way that words suggest the notions
          to which they are annexed. Now, it is known a word pronounced with
          certain circumstances, or in a certain context with other words,
          hath not always the same import and signification that it hath when
          pronounced in some other circumstances, or different context of
          words. The very same visible appearance, as to faintness and all
          other respects, if placed on high, shall not suggest the same
          magnitude that it would if it were seen at an equal distance on a
          level with the eye. The reason whereof is, that we are rarely
          accustomed to view objects at a great height; our concerns lie
          among things situated rather before than above us; and accordingly
          our eyes are not placed on the top of our heads, but in such a
          position as is most convenient for us to see distant objects
          standing in our way. And, this situation of them being a
          circumstance which usually attends the vision of distant objects,
          we may from hence account for (what is commonly observed) an
          object's appearing of different magnitude, even with respect to its
          horizontal extension, on the top of a steeple, e.g. a hundred feet
          high, to one standing below, from what it would if placed at a
          hundred feet distance, on a level with his eye. For, it hath been
          shewn that the judgment we make on the magnitude of a thing depends
          not on the visible appearance only, but also on divers other
          circumstances, any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg
          162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          one of which being omitted or varied may suffice to make some
          alteration in our judgment. Hence, the circumstance of viewing a
          distant object in such a situation as is usual and suits with the
          ordinary posture of the head and eyes, being omitted, and instead
          thereof a different situation of the object, which requires a
          different posture of the head, taking place—it is not to be
          wondered at if the magnitude be judged different. But it will be
          demanded, why a high object should constantly appear less than an
          equidistant low object of the same dimensions; for so it is
          observed to be. It may indeed be granted that the variation of some
          circumstances may vary the judgment made on the magnitude of high
          objects, which we are less used to look at; but it does not hence
          appear why they should be judged less rather than greater? I
          answer, that in case the magnitude of distant objects was suggested
          by the extent of their visible appearance alone, and thought
          proportional thereto, it is certain they would then be judged much
          less than now they seem to be. (Vid. sect. 79.) But, several
          circumstances concurring to form the judgment we make on the
          magnitude of distant objects, by means of which they appear far
          larger than others whose visible appearance hath an equal or even
          greater extension, it follows that upon the change or omission of
          any of those circumstances which are wont to attend the vision of
          distant objects, and so come to influence the judgments made on
          their magnitude, they shall proportionally appear less than
          otherwise they would. For, any of those things that caused an
          object to be thought greater than in proportion to its visible
          extension being either omitted, or applied without the usual
          circumstances, the judgment depends more entirely on the visible
          extension; and consequently the object must be judged less. Thus,
          in the present case the situation of the thing seen being different
          from what it usually is in those objects we have occasion to view,
          and whose magnitude we observe, it follows that the very same
          object being a hundred feet high, should seem less than if it was a
          hundred feet off, on (or nearly on) a level with the eye. What has
          been here set forth seems to me to have no small share in
          contributing to magnify the appearance of the horizontal moon, and
          deserves not to be passed over in the explication of
          it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg

          attentively consider the phenomenon before us, we shall find the
          not discerning between the mediate and immediate objects of sight
          to be the chief cause of the difficulty that occurs in the
          explication of it. The magnitude of the visible moon, or that which
          is the proper and immediate object of vision<a id="noteref_361"
          name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>, is
          no greater when the moon is in the horizon than when it is in the
          meridian. How comes it, therefore, to seem greater in one situation
          than the other? What is it can put this cheat on the understanding?
          It has no other perception of the moon than what it gets by sight.
          And that which is seen is of the same extent—I say, the visible
          appearance hath the very same, or rather a less, magnitude, when
          the moon is viewed in the horizontal than when in the meridional
          position. And yet it is esteemed greater in the former than in the
          latter. Herein consists the difficulty; which doth vanish and admit
          of the most easy solution, if we consider that as the visible moon
          is not greater in the horizon than in the meridian, so neither is
          it thought to be so. It hath been already shewn that, in any act of
          vision, the visible object absolutely, or in itself, is little
          taken notice of—the mind still carrying its view from that to some
          tangible ideas, which have been observed to be connected with it,
          and by that means come to be suggested by it. So that when a thing
          is said to appear great or small, or whatever estimate be made of
          the magnitude of any thing, this is meant not of the visible but of
          the tangible object. This duly considered, it will be no hard
          matter to reconcile the seeming contradiction there is, that the
          moon should appear of a different bigness, the visible magnitude
          thereof remaining still the same. For, by sect. 56, the very same
          visible extension, with a different faintness, shall suggest a
          different tangible extension. When therefore the horizontal moon is
          said to appear greater than the meridional moon, this must be
          understood, not of a greater visible extension, but of a greater
          tangible extension, which, by reason of the more than ordinary
          faintness of the visible appearance, is suggested to the mind along

          another paper relating to the same affair, by the celebrated Dr.
          Wallis, wherein he attempts to account for that phenomenon; which,
          though it seems not to contain anything new, or different from what
          had been said before by others, I shall nevertheless consider in
          this place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">76. His opinion,
          in short, is this:—We judge not of the magnitude of an object by
          the optic angle alone, but by the optic angle in conjunction with
          the distance. Hence, though the angle remain the same, or even
          become less, yet, if withal the distance seem to have been
          increased, the object shall appear greater. Now, one way whereby we
          estimate the distance of anything is by the number and extent of
          the intermediate objects. When therefore the moon is seen in the
          horizon, the variety of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg
          165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fields, houses, &amp;c. together with the large prospect of the
          wide extended land or sea that lies between the eye and the utmost
          limb of the horizon, suggest unto the mind the idea of greater
          distance, and consequently magnify the appearance. And this,
          according to Dr. Wallis, is the true account of the extraordinary
          largeness attributed by the mind to the horizontal moon, at a time
          when the angle subtended by its diameter is not one jot greater
          than it used to be.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">77. With
          reference to this opinion, not to repeat what has been already said
          concerning distance<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href=
          "#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          shall only observe, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">first</span></em>, that if the prospect of
          interjacent objects be that which suggests the idea of farther
          distance, and this idea of farther distance be the cause that
          brings into the mind the idea of greater magnitude, it should hence
          follow that if one looked at the horizontal moon from behind a
          wall, it would appear no bigger than ordinary. For, in that case,
          the wall interposing cuts off all that prospect of sea and land,
          &amp;c. which might otherwise increase the apparent distance, and
          thereby the apparent magnitude of the moon. Nor will it suffice to
          say, the memory doth even then suggest all that extent of land,
          &amp;c. which lies within the horizon, which suggestion occasions a
          sudden judgment of sense, that the moon is farther off and larger
          than usual. For, ask any man who from such a station beholding the
          horizontal moon shall think her greater than usual, whether he hath
          at that time in his mind any idea of the intermediate objects, or
          long tract of land that lies between his eye and the extreme edge
          of the horizon? and whether it be that idea which is the cause of
          his making the aforementioned judgment? He will, without doubt,
          reply in the negative, and declare the horizontal moon shall appear
          greater than the meridional, though he never thinks of all or any
          of those things that lie between him and it. [And as for the
          absurdity of any idea's introducing into the mind another, whilst
          itself is not perceived, this has already fallen under our
          observation, and is too evident to need any farther enlargement on
          it<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          this hypothesis, to account for the moon's <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class=

          time greater than at another; which, nevertheless, has been shewn
          to be very agreeable to the principles we have laid down, and
          receives a most easy and natural explication from them. [<a id=

          the further clearing up of this point, it is to be observed, that
          what we immediately and properly see are only lights and colours in
          sundry situations and shades, and degrees of faintness and
          clearness, confusion and distinctness. All which visible objects
          are only in the mind; nor do they suggest aught external<a id=

          whether distance or magnitude, otherwise than by habitual
          connexion, as words do things. We are also to remark, that beside
          the straining of the eyes, and beside the vivid and faint, the
          distinct and confused appearances (which, bearing some proportion
          to lines and angles, have been substituted instead of them in the
          foregoing part of this Treatise), there are other means which
          suggest both distance and magnitude—particularly the situation of
          visible points or objects, as upper or lower; the former suggesting
          a farther distance and greater magnitude, the latter a nearer
          distance and lesser magnitude—all which is an effect only of custom
          and experience, there being really nothing intermediate in the line
          of distance between the uppermost and the lowermost, which are both
          equidistant, or rather at no distance from the eye; as there is
          also nothing in upper or lower which by necessary connexion should
          suggest greater or lesser magnitude. Now, as these customary
          experimental means of suggesting distance do likewise suggest
          magnitude, so they suggest the one as immediately as the other. I
          say, they do not (vide sect. 53) first suggest distance, and then
          leave the mind from thence to infer or compute magnitude, but
          suggest magnitude as immediately and directly as they suggest
          distance.]</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">78. This
          phenomenon of the horizontal moon is a clear instance of the
          insufficiency of lines and angles for explaining the way wherein
          the mind perceives and estimates the magnitude of outward objects.
          There is, nevertheless, a use of computation by them<a id=

          and are proportional to those other ideas or perceptions which are
          the true and immediate occasions that suggest to the mind the
          apparent magnitude of things. But this in general may, I think, be
          observed concerning mathematical computation in optics—that it can
          never<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href=

          since the judgments we make of the magnitude of external things do
          often depend on several circumstances which are not proportional to
          or capable of being defined by lines and angles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">79. From what
          has been said, we may safely deduce this consequence, to wit, that
          a man born blind, and made to see, would, at first opening of his
          eyes, make a very different judgment of the magnitude of objects
          intromitted by them from what others do. He would not consider the
          ideas of sight with reference to, or as having any connexion with,
          the ideas of touch. His view of them being entirely terminated
          within themselves, he can no otherwise judge them great or small
          than as they contain a greater or lesser number of visible points.
          Now, it being certain that any visible point can cover or exclude
          from view only one other visible point, it follows that whatever
          object intercepts the view of another hath an equal number of
          visible points with it; and, consequently, they shall both be
          thought by him to have the same magnitude. Hence, it is evident one
          in those circumstances would judge his thumb, with which he might
          hide a tower, or hinder its being seen, equal to that tower; or his
          hand, the interposition whereof might conceal the firmament from
          his view, equal to the firmament: how great an inequality soever
          there may, in our apprehensions, seem to be betwixt those two
          things, because of the customary and close connexion that has grown
          up in our minds between the objects of sight and touch, whereby the
          very different and distinct ideas of those two senses are so
          blended and confounded together as to be mistaken for one and the
          same thing—out of which prejudice we cannot easily extricate
          ourselves.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg

          better explaining the nature of vision, and setting the manner
          wherein we perceive magnitudes in a due light, I shall proceed to
          make some observations concerning matters relating thereto, whereof
          the want of reflection, and duly separating between tangible and
          visible ideas, is apt to create in us mistaken and confused
          notions. And, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">minimum visibile</span></span> is exactly
          equal in all beings whatsoever that are endowed with the visive

          exquisite formation of the eye, no peculiar sharpness of sight, can
          make it less in one creature than in another; for, it not being
          distinguishable into parts, nor in anywise consisting of them, it
          must necessarily be the same to all. For, suppose it otherwise, and
          that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">minimum
          visibile</span></span> of a mite, for instance, be less than the
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">minimum visibile</span></span> of a man; the
          latter therefore may, by detraction of some part, be made equal to
          the former. It doth therefore consist of parts, which is
          inconsistent with the notion of a <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">minimum visibile</span></span> or point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">81. It will,
          perhaps, be objected, that the <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">minimum visibile</span></span> of a man doth
          really and in itself contain parts whereby it surpasses that of a
          mite, though they are not perceivable by the man. To which I
          answer, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">minimum
          visibile</span></span> having (in like manner as all other the
          proper and immediate objects of sight) been shewn not to have any
          existence without the mind of him who sees it, it follows there
          cannot be any part of it that is not actually perceived and
          therefore visible. Now, for any object to contain several distinct
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name=
          "Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> visible parts, and
          at the same time to be a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">minimum
          visibile</span></span>, is a manifest contradiction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">82. Of these
          visible points we see at all times an equal number. It is every
          whit as great when our view is contracted and bounded by near
          objects as when it is extended to larger and remoter ones. For, it
          being impossible that one <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">minimum
          visibile</span></span> should obscure or keep out of sight more
          than one other, it is a plain consequence that, when my view is on
          all sides bounded by the walls of my study, I see just as many
          visible points as I could in case that, by the removal of the
          study-walls and all other obstructions, I had a full prospect of
          the circumjacent fields, mountains, sea, and open firmament. For,
          so long as I am shut up within the walls, by their interposition
          every point of the external objects is covered from my view. But,
          each point that is seen being able to cover or exclude from sight
          one only other corresponding point, it follows that, whilst my
          sight is confined to those narrow walls, I see as many points, or
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">minima visibilia</span></span>, as I should
          were those walls away, by looking on all the external objects whose
          prospect is intercepted by them. Whenever, therefore, we are said
          to have a greater prospect at one time than another, this must be
          understood with relation, not to the proper and immediate, but the
          secondary and mediate objects of vision—which, as hath been shewn,
          do properly belong to the touch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">83. The visive
          faculty, considered with reference to its immediate objects, may be
          found to labour of two defects. <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em>,
          in respect of the extent or number of visible points that are at
          once perceivable by it, which is narrow and limited to a certain
          degree. It can take in at one view but a certain determinate number
          of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">minima
          visibilia</span></span>, beyond which it cannot extend its
          prospect. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em>, our sight is defective
          in that its view is not only narrow, but also for the most part
          confused. Of those things that we take in at one prospect, we can
          see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly; and the more we fix
          our sight on any one object, by so much the darker and more
          indistinct shall the rest appear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">84.
          Corresponding to these two defects of sight, we may imagine as many
          perfections, to wit, 1st. That of comprehending in one view a
          greater number of visible points; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> 2dly, of being able to view them all equally
          and at once, with the utmost clearness and distinction. That those
          perfections are not actually in some intelligences of a different
          order and capacity from ours, it is impossible for us to know<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">85. In neither
          of those two ways do microscopes contribute to the improvement of
          sight. For, when we look through a microscope, we neither see more
          visible points, nor are the collateral points more distinct, than
          when we look with the naked eye at objects placed at a due
          distance. A microscope brings us, as it were, into a new world. It
          presents us with a new scene of visible objects, quite different
          from what we behold with the naked eye. But herein consists the
          most remarkable difference, to wit, that whereas the objects
          perceived by the eye alone have a certain connexion with tangible
          objects, whereby we are taught to foresee what will ensue upon the
          approach or application of distant objects to the parts of our own
          body—which much conduceth to its preservation<a id="noteref_377"

          is not the like connexion between things tangible and those visible
          objects that are perceived by help of a fine microscope.</p>

          evident that, were our eyes turned into the nature of microscopes,
          we should not be much benefitted by the change. We should be
          deprived of the forementioned advantage we at present receive by
          the visive faculty, and have left us only the empty amusement of
          seeing, without any other benefit arising from it. But, in that
          case, it will perhaps be said, our sight would be endued with a far
          greater sharpness and penetration than it now hath. But I would
          fain know wherein consists that sharpness which is esteemed so
          great an excellency of sight. It is certain, from what we have
          already shewn<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href=

          constantly the same. And in the case of microscopical eyes, I see
          only this difference, to wit, that upon the ceasing of a certain
          observable connexion betwixt the divers perceptions of sight and
          touch, which before enabled us to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          whole, it seems that if we consider the use and end of sight,
          together with the present state and circumstances of our being, we
          shall not find any great cause to complain of any defect or
          imperfection in it, or easily conceive how it could be mended. With
          such admirable wisdom is that faculty contrived, both for the

          finished what I intended to say concerning the Distance and
          Magnitude of objects, I come now to treat of the manner wherein the
          mind perceives by sight their Situation<a id="noteref_379" name=

          Among the discoveries of the last age, it is reputed none of the
          least, that the manner of vision has been more clearly explained
          than ever it had been before. There is, at this day, no one
          ignorant that the pictures of external objects are painted on the
          retina or fund of the eye; that we can see nothing which is not so
          painted; and that, according as the picture is more distinct or
          confused, so also is the perception we have of the object<a id=
          "noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a>. But
          then, in this explication of vision, there occurs one mighty
          difficulty, viz. the objects are painted in an inverted order on
          the bottom of the eye: the upper part of any object being painted
          on the lower part of the eye, and the lower part of the object on
          the upper part of the eye; and so also as to right and left. Since
          therefore the pictures are thus inverted, it is demanded, how it
          comes to pass that we see the objects erect and in their natural
          posture?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">89. In answer to
          this difficulty, we are told that the mind, perceiving an impulse
          of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye, considers this ray
          as coming in a direct line from the lower part of the object; and,
          in like manner, tracing the ray that strikes on the lower part of
          the eye, it is directed to the upper part of the object. Thus, in
          the adjacent figure, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">C</span></span>, the lower point of the object
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ABC</span></span>, is projected on
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">c</span></span> the upper part of the eye. So
          likewise, the highest point <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">A</span></span> is projected on <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span> the
          lowest part of the eye; which makes the representation <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cba</span></span>
          inverted. But the mind—considering <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the stroke that is made on <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span> as
          coming in the straight line <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cc</span></span> from the lower end of the
          object; and the stroke or impulse on <span class=

          coming in the line <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Aa</span></span> from the upper end of the
          object—is directed to make a right judgment of the situation of the
          object <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ABC</span></span>, notwithstanding the picture
          of it be inverted. Moreover, this is illustrated by conceiving a
          blind man, who, holding in his hands two sticks that cross each
          other, doth with them touch the extremities of an object, placed in
          a perpendicular situation<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381"
          href="#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a>. It
          is certain this man will judge that to be the upper part of the
          object which he touches with the stick held in the undermost hand,
          and that to be the lower part of the object which he touches with
          the stick in his uppermost hand. This is the common explication of
          the erect appearance of objects, which is generally received and
          acquiesced in, being (as Mr. Molyneux tells us, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diopt.</span></span>
          part ii. ch. vii. p. 289) <span class="tei tei-q">“allowed by all
          men as satisfactory.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">90. But this
          account to me does not seem in any degree true. Did I perceive
          those impulses, decussations, and directions of the rays of light,
          in like manner as hath been set forth, then, indeed, it would not
          at first view be altogether void of probability. And there might be
          some pretence for the comparison of the blind man and his cross
          sticks. But the case is far otherwise. I know very well that I
          perceive no such thing. And, of consequence, I cannot thereby make
          an estimate of the situation of objects. Moreover, I appeal to any
          one's experience, whether he be conscious to himself that he thinks
          on the intersection made by the radius pencils, or pursues the
          impulses they give in right lines, whenever he perceives by sight
          the position of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg
          173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          any object? To me it seems evident that crossing and tracing of the
          rays, &amp;c. is never thought on by children, idiots, or, in
          truth, by any other, save only those who have applied themselves to
          the study of optics. And for the mind to judge of the situation of
          objects by those things without perceiving them, or to perceive
          them without knowing it<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a>, take
          which you please, it is perfectly beyond my comprehension. Add to
          this, that the explaining the manner of vision by the example of
          cross sticks, and hunting for the object along the axes of the
          radius pencils, doth suppose the proper objects of sight to be
          perceived at a distance from us, contrary to what hath been
          demonstrated<a id="noteref_383" name="noteref_383" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">383</span></span></a>. [We
          may therefore venture to pronounce this opinion, concerning the way
          wherein the mind perceives the erect appearance of objects, to be
          of a piece with those other tenets of writers in optics, which in
          the foregoing parts of this treatise we have had occasion to
          examine and refute<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href=
          "#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">91. It remains,
          therefore, that we look for some other explication of this
          difficulty. And I believe it not impossible to find one, provided
          we examine it to the bottom, and carefully distinguish between the
          ideas of sight and touch; which cannot be too oft inculcated in
          treating of vision<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href=

          more especially throughout the consideration of this affair, we
          ought to carry that distinction in our thoughts; for that from want
          of a right understanding thereof, the difficulty of explaining
          erect vision seems chiefly to arise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">92. In order to
          disentangle our minds from whatever prejudices we may entertain
          with relation to the subject in hand, nothing seems more apposite
          than the taking into our thoughts the case of one born blind, and
          afterwards, when grown up, made to see. And—though perhaps it may
          not be a task altogether easy and familiar to us, to divest
          ourselves entirely of the experiences received from sight, so as to
          be able to put our thoughts exactly in the posture of such a
          one's—we must, nevertheless, as far as possible, endeavour to frame
          true conceptions of what might reasonably be supposed to pass in
          his mind<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href=
          "#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">93. It is
          certain that a man actually blind, and who had continued so from
          his birth, would, by the sense of feeling, attain to have ideas of
          upper and lower. By the motion of his hand, he might discern the
          situation of any tangible object placed within his reach. That part
          on which he felt himself supported, or towards which he perceived
          his body to gravitate, he would term <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lower</span></em>,
          and the contrary to this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">upper</span></em>; and accordingly denominate
          whatsoever objects he touched.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">94. But then,
          whatever judgments he makes concerning the situation of objects are
          confined to those only that are perceivable by touch. All those
          things that are intangible, and of a spiritual nature—his thoughts
          and desires, his passions, and in general all the modifications of
          his soul—to these he would never apply the terms upper and lower,
          except only in a metaphorical sense. He may perhaps, by way of
          allusion, speak of high or low thoughts: but those terms, in their
          proper signification, would never be applied to anything that was
          not conceived to exist without the mind. For, a man born blind, and
          remaining in the same state, could mean nothing else by the words
          higher and lower than a greater or lesser distance from the earth;
          which distance he would measure by the motion or application of his
          hand, or some other part of his body. It is, therefore, evident
          that all those things which, in respect of each other, would by him
          be thought higher or lower, must be such as were conceived to exist
          without his mind, in the ambient space<a id="noteref_387" name=
          "noteref_387" href="#note_387"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">95. Whence it
          plainly follows, that such a one, if we suppose him made to see,
          would not at first sight think that anything he saw was high or
          low, erect or inverted. For, it hath been already demonstrated, in
          sect. 41, that he would not think the things he perceived by sight
          to be at any distance from him, or without his mind. The objects to
          which he had hitherto been used to apply the terms up and down,
          high and low, were such only as affected, or were some way
          perceived by his touch. But the proper <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> objects of vision make a new set of ideas,
          perfectly distinct and different from the former, and which can in
          no sort make themselves perceived by touch. There is, therefore,
          nothing at all that could induce him to think those terms
          applicable to them. Nor would he ever think it, till such time as
          he had observed their connexion with tangible objects, and the same
          prejudice<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href=

          to insinuate itself into his understanding, which, from their
          infancy, had grown up in the understandings of other men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">96. To set this
          matter in a clearer light, I shall make use of an example. Suppose
          the above-mentioned blind person, by his touch, perceives a man to
          stand erect. Let us inquire into the manner of this. By the
          application of his hand to the several parts of a human body, he
          had perceived different tangible ideas; which being collected into
          sundry complex ones<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href=
          "#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> have
          distinct names annexed to them. Thus, one combination of a certain
          tangible figure, bulk, and consistency of parts is called the head;
          another the hand; a third the foot, and so of the rest—all which
          complex ideas could, in his understanding, be made up only of ideas
          perceivable by touch. He had also, by his touch, obtained an idea
          of earth or ground, towards which he perceives the parts of his
          body to have a natural tendency. Now—by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">erect</span></em>
          nothing more being meant than that perpendicular position of a man
          wherein his feet are nearest to the earth—if the blind person, by
          moving his hand over the parts of the man who stands before him, do
          perceive the tangible ideas that compose the head to be farthest
          from, and those that compose the feet to be nearest to, that other
          combination of tangible ideas which he calls earth, he will
          denominate that man erect. But, if we suppose him on a sudden to
          receive his sight, and that he behold a man standing before him, it
          is evident, in that case, he would neither judge the man he sees to
          be erect nor inverted; for he, never having known those terms
          applied to any other save tangible things, or which existed in the
          space without him, and what he sees neither being tangible, nor
          perceived as existing without, he could not <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> know that, in propriety of language,
          they were applicable to it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">97. Afterwards,
          when, upon turning his head or eyes up and down to the right and
          left, he shall observe the visible objects to change, and shall
          also attain to know that they are called by the same names, and
          connected with the objects perceived by touch; then, indeed, he
          will come to speak of them and their situation in the same terms
          that he has been used to apply to tangible things: and those that
          he perceives by turning up his eyes he will call upper, and those
          that by turning down his eyes he will call lower.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">98. And this
          seems to me the true reason why he should think those objects
          uppermost that are painted on the lower part of his eye. For, by
          turning the eye up they shall be distinctly seen; as likewise they
          that are painted on the highest part of the eye shall be distinctly
          seen by turning the eye down, and are for that reason esteemed
          lowest. For we have shewn that to the immediate objects of sight,
          considered in themselves, he would not attribute the terms high and
          low. It must therefore be on account of some circumstances which
          are observed to attend them. And these, it is plain, are the
          actions of turning the eye up and down, which suggest a very
          obvious reason why the mind should denominate the objects of sight
          accordingly high or low. And, without this motion of the eye—this
          turning it up and down in order to discern different
          objects—doubtless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          relating to the position of tangible objects, would never have been
          transferred, or in any degree apprehended to belong to the ideas of
          sight, the mere act of seeing including nothing in it to that
          purpose; whereas the different situations of the eye naturally
          direct the mind to make a suitable judgment of the situation of
          objects intromitted by it<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390"

          the several ideas of sight and touch, he will be able, by the
          perception he has of the situation of visible things in respect of
          one another, to make a sudden and true estimate of the situation of
          outward, tangible things corresponding to them. And thus

          objects, which do not properly fall under that sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">100. I know we
          are very prone to think that, if just made to see, we should judge
          of the situation of visible things as we do now. But, we are also
          as prone to think that, at first sight, we should in the same way
          apprehend the distance and magnitude of objects, as we do now;
          which hath been shewn to be a false and groundless persuasion. And,
          for the like reasons, the same censure may be passed on the
          positive assurance that most men, before they have thought
          sufficiently of the matter, might have of their being able to
          determine by the eye, at first view, whether objects were erect or
          inverse.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">101. It will
          perhaps be objected to our opinion, that a man, for instance, being
          thought erect when his feet are next the earth, and inverted when
          his head is next the earth, it doth hence follow that, by the mere
          act of vision, without any experience or altering the situation of
          the eye, we should have determined whether he were erect or
          inverted. For both the earth itself, and the limbs of the man who
          stands thereon, being equally perceived by sight, one cannot choose
          seeing what part of the man is nearest the earth, and what part
          farthest from it, i.e. whether he be erect or inverted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">102. To which I
          answer, the ideas which constitute the tangible earth and man are
          entirely different from those which constitute the visible earth
          and man. Nor was it possible, by virtue of the visive faculty
          alone, without superadding any experience of touch, or altering the
          position of the eye, ever to have known, or so much as suspected,
          there had been any relation or connexion between them. Hence, a man
          at first view would not denominate anything he saw, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earth</span></em>,
          or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">head</span></em>, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foot</span></em>;
          and consequently, he could not tell, by the mere act of vision,
          whether the head or feet were nearest the earth. Nor, indeed, would
          we have thereby any thought of earth or man, erect or inverse, at
          all—which will be made yet <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> more evident, if we nicely observe, and make
          a particular comparison between, the ideas of both senses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">103. That which
          I see is only variety of light and colours. That which I feel is
          hard or soft, hot or cold, rough or smooth. What similitude, what
          connexion, have those ideas with these? Or, how is it possible that
          any one should see reason to give one and the same name<a id=
          "noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class=

          combinations of ideas so very different, before he had experienced
          their co-existence? We do not find there is any necessary connexion
          betwixt this or that tangible quality, and any colour whatsoever.
          And we may sometimes perceive colours, where there is nothing to be
          felt. All which doth make it manifest that no man, at first
          receiving of his sight<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href=
          "#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a>,
          would know there was any agreement between this or that particular
          object of his sight and any object of touch he had been already
          acquainted with. The colours therefore of the head would to him no
          more suggest the idea of head<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395"
          href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a> than
          they would the idea of feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">104. Farther, we
          have at large shewn (vid. sect. 63 and 64) there is no discoverable
          necessary connexion between any given visible magnitude and any one
          particular tangible magnitude; but that it is entirely the result
          of custom and experience, and depends on foreign and accidental
          circumstances, that we can, by the perception of visible extension,
          inform ourselves what may be the extension of any tangible object
          connected with it. Hence, it is certain, that neither the visible
          magnitude of head or foot would bring along with them into the
          mind, at first opening of the eyes, the respective tangible
          magnitudes of those parts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">105. By the
          foregoing section, it is plain the visible figure of any part of
          the body hath no necessary connexion with the tangible figure
          thereof, so as at first sight to suggest it to the mind. For,
          figure is the termination of magnitude. Whence it follows that no
          visible magnitude having in its own nature an aptness to suggest
          any one particular tangible magnitude, so neither can any visible
          figure be inseparably connected with its corresponding tangible
          figure, so as of itself, and in a way prior to experience, it might
          suggest it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
          179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to the understanding. This will be farther evident, if we consider
          that what seems smooth and round to the touch may to sight, if
          viewed through a microscope, seem quite otherwise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">106. From all
          which, laid together and duly considered, we may clearly deduce
          this inference:—In the first act of vision, no idea entering by the
          eye would have a perceivable connexion with the ideas to which the
          names earth, man, head, foot, &amp;c. were annexed in the
          understanding of a person blind from his birth; so as in any sort
          to introduce them into his mind, or make themselves be called by
          the same names, and reputed the same things with them, as
          afterwards they come to be.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">107. There doth,
          nevertheless, remain one difficulty, which to some may seem to
          press hard on our opinion, and deserve not to be passed over. For,
          though it be granted that neither the colour, size, nor figure of
          the visible feet have any necessary connexion with the ideas that
          compose the tangible feet, so as to bring them at first sight into
          my mind, or make me in danger of confounding them, before I had
          been used to and for some time experienced their connexion; yet
          thus much seems undeniable, namely, that the number of the visible
          feet being the same with that of the tangible feet, I may from
          hence, without any experience of sight, reasonably conclude that
          they represent or are connected with the feet rather than the head.
          I say, it seems the idea of two visible feet will sooner suggest to
          the mind the idea of two tangible feet than of one head—so that the
          blind man, upon first reception of the visive faculty, might know
          which were the feet or two, and which the head or one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">108. In order to
          get clear of this seeming difficulty, we need only observe that
          diversity of visible objects does not necessarily infer diversity
          of tangible objects corresponding to them. A picture painted with
          great variety of colours affects the touch in one uniform manner;
          it is therefore evident that I do not, by any necessary
          consecution, independent of experience, judge of the number of
          things tangible from the number of things visible. I should not
          therefore at first opening my eyes conclude that because I see two
          I shall feel two. How, therefore, can I, before experience teaches
          me, know that the visible legs, because <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> two, are connected with the tangible legs; or
          the visible head, because one, is connected with the tangible head?
          The truth is, the things I see are so very different and
          heterogeneous from the things I feel that the perception of the one
          would never have suggested the other to my thoughts, or enabled me
          to pass the least judgment thereon, until I had experienced their
          connexion<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href=
          "#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">109. But, for a
          fuller illustration of this matter, it ought to be considered, that
          number (however some may reckon it amongst the primary
          qualities<a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href=
          "#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a>) is
          nothing fixed and settled, really existing in things themselves. It
          is entirely the creature of the mind, considering either a simple
          idea by itself, or any combination of simple ideas to which it
          gives one name, and so makes it pass for a unit. According as the
          mind variously combines its ideas, the unit varies; and as the
          unit, so the number, which is only a collection of units, doth also
          vary. We call a window one, a chimney one; and yet a house, in
          which there are many windows and many chimneys, has an equal right
          to be called one; and many houses go to the making of one city. In
          these and the like instances, it is evident the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unit</span></em>
          constantly relates to the particular draughts the mind makes of its
          ideas, to which it affixes names, and wherein it <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> includes more or less, as best suits
          its own ends and purposes. Whatever therefore the mind considers as
          one, that is an unit. Every combination of ideas is considered as
          one thing by the mind, and in token thereof is marked by one name.
          Now, this naming and combining together of ideas is perfectly
          arbitrary, and done by the mind in such sort as experience shews it
          to be most convenient—without which our ideas had never been
          collected into such sundry distinct combinations as they now
          are.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">110. Hence, it
          follows that a man born blind, and afterwards, when grown up, made
          to see, would not, in the first act of vision, parcel out the ideas
          of sight into the same distinct collections that others do who have
          experienced which do regularly co-exist and are proper to be
          bundled up together under one name. He would not, for example, make
          into one complex idea, and thereby esteem and unite all those
          particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot. For,
          there can be no reason assigned why he should do so, barely upon
          his seeing a man stand upright before him. There crowd into his
          mind the ideas which compose the visible man, in company with all
          the other ideas of sight perceived at the same time. But, all these
          ideas offered at once to his view he would not distribute into
          sundry distinct combinations, till such time as, by observing the
          motion of the parts of the man and other experiences, he comes to
          know which are to be separated and which to be collected
          together<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href=
          "#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">111. From what
          hath been premised, it is plain the objects of sight and touch
          make, if I may so say, two sets of ideas, which are widely
          different from each other. To objects of either kind we
          indifferently attribute the terms high and low, right and left, and
          such like, denoting the position or situation of things; but then
          we must well observe that the position of any object is determined
          with respect only to objects of the same sense. We say any object
          of touch is high or low, according as it is more or less distant
          from the tangible earth: and in like manner we <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> denominate any object of sight high or
          low, in proportion as it is more or less distant from the visible
          earth. But, to define the situation of visible things with relation
          to the distance they bear from any tangible thing, or <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>, this were absurd and
          perfectly unintelligible. For all visible things are equally in the
          mind, and take up no part of the external space; and consequently
          are equidistant from any tangible thing which exists without the
          mind<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href=
          "#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">112. Or rather,
          to speak truly, the proper objects of sight are at no distance,
          neither near nor far from any tangible thing. For, if we inquire
          narrowly into the matter, we shall find that those things only are
          compared together in respect of distance which exist after the same
          manner, or appertain unto the same sense. For, by the distance
          between any two points, nothing more is meant than the number of
          intermediate points. If the given points are visible, the distance
          between them is marked out by the number of the interjacent visible
          points; if they are tangible, the distance between them is a line
          consisting of tangible points; but, if they are one tangible and
          the other visible, the distance between them doth neither consist
          of points perceivable by sight nor by touch, i.e. it is utterly
          inconceivable<a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href=
          "#note_400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a>.
          This, perhaps, will not find an easy admission into all men's
          understanding. However, I should gladly be informed whether it be
          not true, by any one who will be at the pains to reflect a little,
          and apply it home to his thoughts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">113. The not
          observing what has been delivered in the two last sections, seems
          to have occasioned no small part of the difficulty that occurs in
          the business of direct appearances. The head, which is painted
          nearest the earth, seems to be farthest from it; and on the other
          hand, the feet, which are painted farthest from the earth, are
          thought nearest to it. Herein lies the difficulty, which vanishes
          if we express the thing more clearly and free from ambiguity,
          thus:—How comes it that, to the eye, the visible head, which is
          nearest the tangible earth, seems farthest from the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> earth; and the visible feet, which are
          farthest from the tangible earth, seem nearest the earth? The
          question being thus proposed, who sees not the difficulty is
          founded on a supposition that the eye or visive faculty, or rather
          the soul by means thereof, should judge of the situation of visible
          objects with reference to their distance from the tangible earth?
          Whereas, it is evident the tangible earth is not perceived by
          sight. And it hath been shewn, in the two last preceding sections,
          that the location of visible objects is determined only by the
          distance they bear from one another, and that it is nonsense to
          talk of distance, far or near, between a visible and tangible
          thing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">114. If we
          confine our thoughts to the proper objects of sight, the whole is
          plain and easy. The head is painted farthest from, and the feet
          nearest to, the visible earth; and so they appear to be. What is
          there strange or unaccountable in this? Let us suppose the pictures
          in the fund of the eye to be the immediate objects of sight<a id=
          "noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a>. The
          consequence is that things should appear in the same posture they
          are painted in; and is it not so? The head which is seen seems
          farthest from the earth which is seen; and the feet which are seen
          seem nearest to the earth which is seen. And just so they are
          painted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">115. But, say
          you, the picture of the man is inverted, and yet the appearance is
          erect. I ask, what mean you by the picture of the man, or, which is
          the same thing, the visible man's being inverted? You tell me it is
          inverted, because the heels are uppermost and the head undermost?
          Explain me this. You say that by the head's being undermost, you
          mean that it is nearest to the earth; and, by the heels being
          uppermost, that they are farthest from the earth. I ask again, what
          earth you mean? You cannot mean the earth that is painted on the
          eye or the visible earth—for the picture of the head is farthest
          from the picture of the earth, and the picture of the feet nearest
          to the picture of the earth; and accordingly the visible head is
          farthest from the visible earth, and the visible feet nearest to
          it. It remains, therefore, that you mean the tangible earth; and so
          determine the situation of visible things with respect to tangible
          things—contrary to what hath been demonstrated in sect. 111 and
          112. The two <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg

          distinct provinces of sight and touch should be considered apart,
          and as though their objects had no intercourse, no manner of
          relation to one another, in point of distance or position<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">116. Farther,
          what greatly contributes to make us mistake in this matter is that,
          when we think of the pictures in the fund of the eye, we imagine
          ourselves looking on the fund of another's eye, or another looking
          on the fund of our own eye, and beholding the pictures painted
          thereon. Suppose two eyes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">A</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">A</span></span> from some distance looking on
          the pictures in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">B</span></span> sees them inverted, and for
          that reason concludes they are inverted in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>. But
          this is wrong. There are projected in little on the bottom of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">A</span></span> the images of the pictures of,
          suppose, man, earth, &amp;c., which are painted on <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>. And,
          besides these, the eye <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">B</span></span> itself, and the objects which
          environ it, together with another earth, are projected in a larger
          size on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">A</span></span>. Now, by the eye <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></span> these
          larger images are deemed the true objects, and the lesser only
          pictures in miniature. And it is with respect to those greater
          images that it determines the situation of the smaller images; so
          that, comparing the little man with the great earth, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></span>
          judges him inverted, or that the feet are farthest from and the
          head nearest to the great earth. Whereas, if <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></span>
          compare the little man with the little earth, then he will appear
          erect, i.e. his head shall seem farthest from and his feet nearest
          to the little earth. But we must consider that <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span> does
          not see two earths as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">A</span></span> does. It sees only what is
          represented by the little pictures in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></span>, and
          consequently shall judge the man erect. For, in truth, the man in
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">B</span></span> is not inverted, for there the
          feet are next the earth; but it is the representation of it in
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">A</span></span> which is inverted, for there
          the head of the representation of the picture of the man in
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">B</span></span> is next the earth, and the
          feet farthest from the earth—meaning the earth which is without the
          representation of the pictures in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>. For,
          if you take the little linages of the pictures in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>, and
          consider them by themselves, and with respect only to one another,
          they are all erect and in their natural posture.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">117. Farther,
          there lies a mistake in our imagining that the pictures of
          external<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href=
          "#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          objects are painted on the bottom of the eye. It has been shewn
          there is no resemblance between the ideas of sight and things
          tangible. It hath likewise been demonstrated<a id="noteref_404"
          name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a>, that
          the proper objects of sight do not exist without the mind. Whence
          it clearly follows that the pictures painted on the bottom of the
          eye are not the pictures of external objects. Let any one consult
          his own thoughts, and then tell me, what affinity, what likeness,
          there is between that certain variety and disposition of colours
          which constitute the visible man, or picture of a man, and that
          other combination of far different ideas, sensible by touch, which
          compose the tangible man. But, if this be the case, how come they
          to be accounted pictures or images, since that supposes them to
          copy or represent some originals or other?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">118. To which I
          answer—In the forementioned instance, the eye <span class=

          the little images, included within the representation of the other
          eye <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">B</span></span>, to be pictures or copies,
          whereof the archetypes are not things existing without<a id=

          the larger pictures<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href=

          projected on its own fund; and which by <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></span> are
          not thought pictures, but the originals or true things themselves.
          Though if we suppose a third eye <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span>, from
          a due distance, to behold the fund of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></span>, then
          indeed the things projected thereon shall, to <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span>, seem
          pictures or images, in the same sense that those projected on
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">B</span></span> do to <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">119. Rightly to
          conceive the business in hand, we must carefully distinguish
          between the ideas of sight and touch, between the visible and
          tangible eye; for certainly on the tangible eye nothing either is
          or seems to be painted. Again, the visible eye, as well as all
          other visible objects, hath been shewn to exist only in the
          mind<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href=

          which, perceiving its own ideas, and comparing them together, does
          call some pictures in respect to others. What hath been said, being
          rightly comprehended and laid together, does, I think, afford a
          full and genuine explication of the erect appearance of
          objects—which phenomenon, I must <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> confess, I do not see how it can be explained
          by any theories of vision hitherto made public.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">120. In treating
          of these things, the use of language is apt to occasion some
          obscurity and confusion, and create in us wrong ideas. For,
          language being accommodated to the common notions and prejudices of
          men, it is scarce possible to deliver the naked and precise truth,
          without great circumlocution, impropriety, and (to an unwary
          reader) seeming contradictions. I do, therefore, once for all,
          desire whoever shall think it worth his while to understand what I
          have written concerning vision, that he would not stick in this or
          that phrase or manner of expression, but candidly collect my
          meaning from the whole sum and tenor of my discourse, and, laying
          aside the words<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href=

          shewn the way wherein the mind, by mediation of visible ideas<a id=
          "noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          come now to inquire more particularly concerning the difference
          between the ideas of sight and touch which are called by the same
          names, and see whether there be any idea common to both
          senses<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href=
          "#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a>. From
          what we have at large set forth and demonstrated in the foregoing
          parts of this treatise, it is plain there is no one self-same
          numerical extension, perceived both by sight and touch; but that
          the particular figures and extensions perceived by sight, however
          they may be called by the same names, and reputed the same things
          with those perceived by touch, are nevertheless different, and have
          an existence very distinct and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> separate from them. So that the question is
          not now concerning the same numerical ideas, but whether there be
          any one and the same sort or species of ideas equally perceivable
          to both senses? or, in other words, whether extension, figure, and
          motion perceived by sight, are not specifically distinct from
          extension, figure, and motion perceived by touch?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">122. But, before
          I come more particularly to discuss this matter, I find it proper
          to take into my thoughts extension in abstract<a id="noteref_412"
          name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a>. For
          of this there is much talk; and I am apt to think that when men
          speak of extension as being an idea common to two senses, it is
          with a secret supposition that we can single out extension from all
          other tangible and visible qualities, and form thereof an abstract
          idea, which idea they will have common both to sight and touch. We
          are therefore to understand by extension in abstract, an idea<a id=
          "noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> of
          extension—for instance, a line or surface entirely stripped of all
          other sensible qualities and circumstances that might determine it
          to any particular existence; it is neither black, nor white, nor
          red, nor hath it any colour at all, or any tangible quality
          whatsoever, and consequently it is of no finite determinate
          magnitude<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href=
          "#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a>; for
          that which bounds or distinguishes one extension from another is
          some quality or circumstance wherein they disagree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">123. Now, I do
          not find that I can perceive, imagine, or anywise frame in my mind
          such an abstract idea as is here spoken of. A line or surface which
          is neither black, nor white, nor blue, nor yellow, &amp;c.; nor
          long, nor short, nor rough, nor smooth, nor square, nor round,
          &amp;c. is perfectly incomprehensible. This I am sure of as to
          myself; how far the faculties of other men may reach they best can
          tell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">124. It is
          commonly said that the object of geometry is <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> abstract extension. But geometry
          contemplates figures: now, figure is the termination of
          magnitude<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href=

          we have shewn that extension in abstract hath no finite determinate
          magnitude; whence it clearly follows that it can have no figure,
          and consequently is not the object of geometry. It is indeed a
          tenet, as well of the modern as the ancient philosophers, that all
          general truths are concerning universal abstract ideas; without
          which, we are told, there could be no science, no demonstration of
          any general proposition in geometry. But it were no hard matter,
          did I think it necessary to my present purpose, to shew that
          propositions and demonstrations in geometry might be universal,
          though they who make them never think of abstract general ideas of
          triangles or circles.</p>

          Understanding</span></span>, B. iv. ch. 7. s. 9.) This is the idea
          which he thinks needful for the enlargement of knowledge, which is
          the subject of mathematical demonstration, and without which we
          could never come to know any general proposition <span class=

          this be the case, it is impossible for me to attain to know even
          the first elements of geometry: since I have not the faculty to

          to his thoughts, it is not improbable he would have owned it above
          all the pains and skill he was master of, to form the
          above-mentioned idea of a triangle, which is made up of manifest

          a man born blind would not, at first reception of his sight, think
          the things he saw were of the same nature with the objects of
          touch, or had anything in common with them; but that they were a
          new set of ideas, perceived in a new manner, and entirely different

          46.) And, as for figure and extension, I leave it to any one that
          shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide
          whether he has any idea intromitted immediately and properly by
          sight save only light and colours: or, whether it be possible for
          him to frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible
          extension, or figure, exclusive of all colour; and, on the other
          hand, whether he can conceive colour without visible extension? For
          my own part, I must confess, I am not able to attain so great a
          nicety of abstraction. I know very well that, in a strict sense, I
          see nothing but light and colours, with their several shades and
          variations. He who beside these doth also perceive by sight ideas
          far different and distinct from them, hath that faculty in a degree
          more perfect and comprehensive than I can pretend to. It must be
          owned, indeed, that, by the mediation of light and colours, other
          far different ideas are suggested to my mind. But so they are by
          hearing<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href=

          then, upon this score, I see no reason why the sight should be
          thought more comprehensive than the hearing, which, beside sounds
          which are peculiar to that sense, doth, by their mediation, suggest
          not only space, figure, and motion, but also all other ideas
          whatsoever that can be signified by words.</p>

          universally received, that <span class="tei tei-q">“quantities of
          the same kind may be added together and make one entire
          sum.”</span> Mathematicians add lines together; but they do not add
          a line to a solid, or conceive it as making one sum with a surface.
          These three kinds of quantity being thought incapable of any such
          mutual addition, and consequently of being compared together in the
          several ways of proportion, are by them for that reason esteemed
          entirely disparate and heterogeneous. Now let any one try in his
          thoughts to add a visible line or surface to a tangible line or
          surface, so as to conceive them making one continued sum or whole.
          He that can do this may think them homogeneous; but he that cannot
          must, by the foregoing axiom, think them heterogeneous. [I
          acknowledge myself to be of the latter sort<a id="noteref_437"

          blue and a red line I can conceive added together into one sum and

          line; but, to make, in my thoughts, one continued line of a visible
          and tangible line added together, is, I find, a task far more
          difficult, and even insurmountable—and I leave it to the reflection
          and experience of every particular person to determine for
          himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">132. A farther
          confirmation of our tenet may be drawn from the solution of Mr.
          Molyneux's problem, published by Mr. Locke in his <span class=

          which I shall set down as it there lies, together with Mr. Locke's
          opinion of it:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Suppose a man born blind,
          and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a
          cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same
          bigness, so as to tell when he felt one and the other, which is the
          cube, and which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed
          on a table, and the blind man made to see: Quære, Whether by his
          sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish, and tell,
          which is the globe, which the cube. To which the acute and
          judicious proposer answers: Not. For, though he has obtained the
          experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch; yet he has
          not yet attained the experience, that what affects his touch so or
          so must affect his sight so or so: or that a protuberant angle in
          the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye
          as it doth in the cube. I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom
          I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this his problem;
          and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be
          able with certainty to say, which was the globe, which the cube,
          whilst he only saw them.”</span> (<span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">133. Now, if a
          square surface perceived by touch be of the same sort with a square
          surface perceived by sight, it is certain the blind man here
          mentioned might know a square surface as soon as he saw it. It is
          no more but introducing into his mind, by a new inlet, an idea he
          has been already well acquainted with. Since therefore he is
          supposed to have known by his touch that a cube is a body
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name=

          surfaces; and that a sphere is not terminated by square
          surfaces—upon the supposition that a visible and tangible square
          differ only <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          follows that he might know, by the unerring mark of the square
          surfaces, which was the cube, and which not, while he only saw
          them. We must therefore allow, either that visible extension and
          figures are specifically distinct from tangible extension and
          figures, or else, that the solution of this problem, given by those

          But, what has been said is, if I mistake not, sufficient to
          convince any one that shall yield a reasonable attention. And, as
          for those that will not be at the pains of a little thought, no
          multiplication of words will ever suffice to make them understand

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">135. I cannot
          let go the above-mentioned problem without some reflection on it.
          It hath been made evident that a man blind from his birth would
          not, at first sight, denominate anything he saw, by the names he
          had been used to appropriate to ideas of touch. (Vid. sect. 106.)
          Cube, sphere, table are words he has known applied to things
          perceivable by touch, but to things perfectly intangible he never
          knew them applied. Those words, in their wonted application, always
          marked out to his mind bodies or solid things which were perceived
          by the resistance they gave. But there is no solidity, no
          resistance or protrusion, perceived by sight. In short, the ideas
          of sight are all new perceptions, to which there be no names
          annexed in his mind; he cannot therefore understand what is said to
          him concerning them. And, to ask of the two bodies he saw placed on
          the table, which was the sphere, which the cube, were to him a
          question downright bantering and unintelligible; nothing he sees
          being able to suggest to his thoughts the idea of body, distance,
          or, in general, of anything he had already known.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">136. It is a
          mistake to think the same<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> thing
          affects both sight and touch. If the same angle or square which is
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name=
          "Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> object of touch be
          also the object of vision, what should hinder the blind man, at
          first sight, from knowing it? For, though the manner wherein it
          affects the sight be different from that wherein it affected his
          touch, yet, there being, beside this manner or circumstance, which
          is new and unknown, the angle or figure, which is old and known, he
          cannot choose but discern it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">137. Visible
          figure and extension having been demonstrated to be of a nature
          entirely different and heterogeneous from tangible figure and
          extension, it remains that we inquire concerning motion. Now, that
          visible motion is not of the same sort with tangible motion seems
          to need no farther proof; it being an evident corollary from what
          we have shewn concerning the difference there is betwixt visible
          and tangible extension. But, for a more full and express proof
          hereof, we need only observe that one who had not yet experienced
          vision would not at first sight know motion<a id="noteref_442"
          name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class=

          Whence it clearly follows that motion perceivable by sight is of a
          sort distinct from motion perceivable by touch. The antecedent I
          prove thus—By touch he could not perceive any motion but what was
          up or down, to the right or left, nearer or farther from him;
          besides these, and their several varieties or complications, it is
          impossible he should have any idea of motion. He would not
          therefore think anything to be motion, or give the name motion to
          any idea, which he could not range under some or other of those
          particular kinds thereof. But, from sect. 95, it is plain that, by
          the mere act of vision, he could not know motion upwards or
          downwards, to the right or left, or in any other possible
          direction. From which I conclude, he would not know motion at all
          at first sight. As for the idea of motion in abstract, I shall not
          waste paper about it, but leave it to my reader to make the best he
          can of it. To me it is perfectly unintelligible<a id="noteref_443"

          situations, I shall not enlarge any farther on this subject, but
          proceed to inquire what may be alleged, with greatest appearance of
          reason, against the proposition we have demonstrated to be true;
          for, where there is so much prejudice to be encountered, a bare and
          naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice. We must also
          satisfy the scruples that men may start in favour of their
          preconceived notions, shew whence the mistake arises, how it came
          to spread, and carefully disclose and root out those false
          persuasions that an early prejudice might have implanted in the
          mind.</p>

          therefore, it will be demanded how visible extension and figures
          come to be called by the same name with tangible extension and
          figures, if they are not of the same kind with them? It must be
          something more than humour or accident that could occasion a custom
          so constant and universal as this, which has obtained in all ages
          and nations of the world, and amongst all ranks of men, the learned
          as well as the illiterate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">140. To which I
          answer, we can no more argue a visible and tangible square to be of
          the same species, from their being called by the same name, than we
          can that a tangible square, and the monosyllable consisting of six
          letters whereby it is marked, are of the same species, because they
          are both called by the same name. It is customary to call written
          words, and the things they signify, by the same name: for, words
          not being regarded in their own nature, or otherwise than as they
          are marks of things, it had been superfluous, and beside the design
          of language, to have given them names distinct from those of the
          things marked by them. The same reason holds here also. Visible
          figures are the marks of tangible figures; and, from sect. 59, it
          is plain that in themselves they are little regarded, or upon any
          other score than for their connexion with tangible figures, which
          by nature they are ordained to signify. And, because this language
          of nature<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href=
          "#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> does
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name=
          "Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not vary in
          different ages or nations, hence it is that in all times and places
          visible figures are called by the same names as the respective
          tangible figures suggested by them; and not because they are alike,
          or of the same sort with them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">141. But, say
          you, surely a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to
          a visible circle: it has four angles, and as many sides; so also
          has the visible square—but the visible circle has no such thing,
          being bounded by one uniform curve, without right lines or angles,
          which makes it unfit to represent the tangible square, but very fit
          to represent the tangible circle. Whence it clearly follows, that
          visible figures are patterns of, or of the same species with, the
          respective tangible figures represented by them; that they are like
          unto them, and of their own nature fitted to represent them, as
          being of the same sort; and that they are in no respect arbitrary
          signs, as words.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">142. I answer,
          it must be acknowledged the visible square is fitter than the
          visible circle to represent the tangible square, but then it is not
          because it is liker, or more of a species with it; but, because the
          visible square contains in it several distinct parts, whereby to
          mark the several distinct corresponding parts of a tangible square,
          whereas the visible circle doth not. The square perceived by touch
          hath four distinct equal sides, so also hath it four distinct equal
          angles. It is therefore necessary that the visible figure which
          shall be most proper to mark it contain four distinct equal parts,
          corresponding to the four sides of the tangible square; as likewise
          four other distinct and equal parts, whereby to denote the four
          equal angles of the tangible square. And accordingly we see the
          visible figures contain in them distinct visible parts, answering
          to the distinct tangible parts of the figures signified or
          suggested by them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">143. But, it
          will not hence follow that any visible figure is like unto or of
          the same species with its corresponding tangible figure—unless it
          be also shewn that not only the number, but also the kind of the
          parts be the same in both. To illustrate this, I observe that
          visible figures represent tangible figures much after the same
          manner that written words do sounds. Now, in this respect, words
          are not arbitrary; it not being indifferent what written word
          stands <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg
          198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          for any sound. But, it is requisite that each word contain in it as
          many distinct characters as there are variations in the sound it
          stands for. Thus, the single letter <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> is
          proper to mark one simple uniform sound; and the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adultery</span></em> is accommodated to
          represent the sound annexed to it—in the formation whereof there
          being eight different collisions or modifications of the air by the
          organs of speech, each of which produces a difference of sound, it
          was fit the word representing it should consist of as many distinct
          characters, thereby to mark each particular difference or part of
          the whole sound. And yet nobody, I presume, will say the single
          letter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a</span></em>, or the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adultery</span></em>, are alike unto or of the
          same species with the respective sounds by them represented. It is
          indeed arbitrary that, in general, letters of any language
          represent sounds at all; but, when that is once agreed, it is not
          arbitrary what combination of letters shall represent this or that
          particular sound. I leave this with the reader to pursue, and apply
          it in his own thoughts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">144. It must be
          confessed that we are not so apt to confound other signs with the
          things signified, or to think them of the same species, as we are
          visible and tangible ideas. But, a little consideration will shew
          us how this may well be, without our supposing them of a like
          nature. These signs are constant and universal; their connexion
          with tangible ideas has been learnt at our first entrance into the
          world; and ever since, almost every moment of our lives, it has
          been occurring to our thoughts, and fastening and striking deeper
          on our minds. When we observe that signs are variable, and of human
          institution; when we remember there was a time they were not
          connected in our minds with those things they now so readily
          suggest, but that their signification was learned by the slow steps
          of experience: this preserves us from confounding them. But, when
          we find the same signs suggest the same things all over the world;
          when we know they are not of human institution, and cannot remember
          that we ever learned their signification, but think that at first
          sight they would have suggested to us the same things they do now:
          all this persuades us they are of the same species as the things
          respectively represented by them, and that it is by a natural
          resemblance they suggest them to our minds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">145. Add to this
          that whenever we make a nice survey <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of any object, successively directing the
          optic axis to each point thereof, there are certain lines and
          figures, described by the motion of the head or eye, which, being
          in truth perceived by feeling<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a>, do
          nevertheless so mix themselves, as it were, with the ideas of sight
          that we can scarce think but they appertain to that sense. Again,
          the ideas of sight enter into the mind several at once, more
          distinct and unmingled than is usual in the other senses beside the
          touch. Sounds, for example, perceived at the same instant, are apt
          to coalesce, if I may so say, into one sound: but we can perceive,
          at the same time, great variety of visible objects, very separate
          and distinct from each other. Now, tangible<a id="noteref_447"
          name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class=

          extension being made up of several distinct coexistent parts, we
          may hence gather another reason that may dispose us to imagine a
          likeness or analogy between the immediate objects of sight and
          touch. But nothing, certainly, does more contribute to blend and
          confound them together, than the strict and close connexion<a id=

          have with each other. We cannot open our eyes but the ideas of
          distance, bodies, and tangible figures are suggested by them. So
          swift, and sudden, and unperceived is the transit from visible to
          tangible ideas that we can scarce forbear thinking them equally the
          immediate object of vision.</p>

          is grounded on these, and whatever other causes may be assigned
          thereof, sticks so fast on our understandings, that it is
          impossible, without obstinate striving and labour of the mind, to
          get entirely clear of it. But then the reluctancy we find in
          rejecting any opinion can be no argument of its truth, to whoever
          considers what has been already shewn with regard to the prejudices
          we entertain concerning the distance, magnitude, and situation of
          objects; prejudices so familiar to our minds, so confirmed and

          there are which, at first sight, incline one to think geometry
          conversant about visible extension. The constant use of the eyes,
          both in the practical and speculative parts of that science, doth
          very much induce us thereto. It would, without doubt, seem odd to a
          mathematician to go about to convince him the diagrams he saw upon
          paper were not the figures, or even the likeness of the figures,
          which make the subject of the demonstration—the contrary being held
          an unquestionable truth, not only by mathematicians, but also by
          those who apply themselves more particularly to the study of logic;
          I mean who consider the nature of science, certainty, and
          demonstration; it being by them assigned as one <span class=

          and evidence of geometry, that in that science the reasonings are
          free from those inconveniences which attend the use of arbitrary
          signs, the very ideas themselves being copied out, and exposed to
          view upon paper. But, by the bye, how well this agrees with what
          they likewise assert of abstract ideas being the object of
          geometrical demonstration I leave to be considered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">151. To come to
          a resolution in this point, we need only observe what has been said
          in sect. 59, 60, 61, where it is shewn that visible extensions in
          themselves are little regarded, and have no settled determinate
          greatness, and that men measure altogether by the application of
          tangible extension to tangible extension. All which makes it
          evident that visible extension and figures are not the object of
          geometry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">152. It is
          therefore plain that visible figures are of the same use in
          geometry that words are. And the one may as well be accounted the
          object of that science as the other; neither of them being any
          otherwise concerned therein than as they represent or suggest to
          the mind the particular tangible figures connected with them. There
          is, indeed, this difference betwixt the signification of tangible
          figures by visible figures, and of ideas by words—that whereas the
          latter is variable and uncertain, depending altogether on the
          arbitrary appointment of men, the former is fixed, and immutably
          the same in all times and places. A visible square, for instance,
          suggests to the mind the same tangible figure in Europe that it
          doth in America. Hence it is, that the voice of nature, which
          speaks to our eyes, is not liable to that misinterpretation and
          ambiguity that languages of human contrivance are unavoidably
          subject to<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href=
          "#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          which may, in some measure, be derived that peculiar evidence and
          clearness of geometrical demonstrations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">153. Though what
          has been said may suffice to shew what ought to be determined with
          relation to the object of geometry, I shall, nevertheless, for the
          fuller illustration thereof, take into my thoughts the case of an
          intelligence or unbodied spirit, which is supposed to see perfectly
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name=
          "Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> well, i.e. to have a
          clear perception of the proper and immediate objects of sight, but
          to have no sense of touch<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457"
          href="#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a>.
          Whether there be any such being in nature or no, is beside my
          purpose to inquire; it suffices, that the supposition contains no
          contradiction in it. Let us now examine what proficiency such a one
          may be able to make in geometry. Which speculation will lead us
          more clearly to see whether the ideas of sight can possibly be the
          object of that science.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">154. <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em>,
          then, it is certain the aforesaid intelligence could have no idea
          of a solid or quantity of three dimensions, which follows from its
          not having any idea of distance. We, indeed, are prone to think
          that we have by sight the ideas of space and solids; which arises
          from our imagining that we do, strictly speaking, see distance, and
          some parts of an object at a greater distance than others; which
          has been demonstrated to be the effect of the experience we have
          had what ideas of touch are connected with such and such ideas
          attending vision. But the intelligence here spoken of is supposed
          to have no experience of touch. He would not, therefore, judge as
          we do, nor have any idea of distance, outness, or profundity, nor
          consequently of space or body, either immediately or by suggestion.
          Whence it is plain he can have no notion of those parts of geometry
          which relate to the mensuration of solids, and their convex or
          concave surfaces, and contemplate the properties of lines generated
          by the section of a solid. The conceiving of any part whereof is
          beyond the reach of his faculties.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">155. <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Farther</span></em>, he cannot comprehend the
          manner wherein geometers describe a right line or circle; the rule
          and compass, with their use, being things of which it is impossible
          he should have any notion. Nor is it an easier matter for him to
          conceive the placing of one plane or angle on another, in order to
          prove their equality; since that supposes some idea of distance, or
          external space. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg
          204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          All which makes it evident our pure intelligence could never attain
          to know so much as the first elements of plain geometry. And
          perhaps, upon a nice inquiry, it will be found he cannot even have
          an idea of plain figures any more than he can of solids; since some
          idea of distance is necessary to form the idea of a geometrical
          plane, as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">156. All that is
          properly perceived by the visive faculty amounts to no more than
          colours with their variations, and different proportions of light
          and shade—but the perpetual mutability and fleetingness of those
          immediate objects of sight render them incapable of being managed
          after the manner of geometrical figures; nor is it in any degree
          useful that they should. It is true there be divers of them
          perceived at once; and more of some, and less of others: but
          accurately to compute their magnitude, and assign precise
          determinate proportions between things so variable and inconstant,
          if we suppose it possible to be done, must yet be a very trifling
          and insignificant labour.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">157. I must
          confess, it seems to be the opinion of some very ingenious men that
          flat or plane figures are immediate objects of sight, though they
          acknowledge solids are not. And this opinion of theirs is grounded
          on what is observed in painting, wherein (say they) the ideas
          immediately imprinted in the mind are only of planes variously
          coloured, which, by a sudden act of the judgment, are changed into
          solids: but, with a little attention, we shall find the planes here
          mentioned as the immediate objects of sight are not visible but
          tangible planes. For, when we say that pictures are planes, we mean
          thereby that they appear to the touch smooth and uniform. But then
          this smoothness and uniformity, or, in other words, this planeness
          of the picture is not perceived immediately by vision; for it
          appeareth to the eye various and multiform.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">158. From all
          which we may conclude that planes are no more the immediate object
          of sight than solids. What we strictly see are not solids, nor yet
          planes variously coloured—they are only diversity of colours. And
          some of these suggest to the mind solids, and others plane figures;
          just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one or
          the other: so that we see planes in the same way that we see
          solids—both being equally suggested by the <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> immediate objects of sight, which accordingly
          are themselves denominated planes and solids. But, though they are
          called by the same names with the things marked by them, they are,
          nevertheless, of a nature entirely different, as hath been
          demonstrated<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href=
          "#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">159. What has
          been said is, if I mistake not, sufficient to decide the question
          we proposed to examine, concerning the ability of a pure spirit,
          such as we have described, to know geometry. It is, indeed, no easy
          matter for us to enter precisely into the thoughts of such an
          intelligence; because we cannot, without great pains, cleverly
          separate and disentangle in our thoughts the proper objects of
          sight from those of touch which are connected with them. This,
          indeed, in a complete degree seems scarce possible to be performed;
          which will not seem strange to us, if we consider how hard it is
          for any one to hear the words of his native language, which is
          familiar to him, pronounced in his ears without understanding them.
          Though he endeavour to disunite the meaning from the sound, it will
          nevertheless intrude into his thoughts, and he shall find it
          extreme difficult, if not impossible, to put himself exactly in the
          posture of a foreigner that never learnt the language, so as to be
          affected barely with the sounds themselves, and not perceive the
          signification annexed to them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">160. By this
          time, I suppose, it is clear that neither abstract nor visible
          extension makes the object of geometry; the not discerning of which
          may, perhaps, have created some difficulty and useless labour in
          mathematics. [<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href=

          thought presumption if <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg

          reputation, and much of that ardour with which men study the
          abstruse and fine geometry be abated, if what to me, and those few
          to whom I have imparted it, seems evidently true, should really
          prove to be so.]</p>

          answer, if this objection be sounded to the bottom, it will be
          found to mean no more than that the same particle of matter which
          is marked to a man by one <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">minima visibilia</span></span>. But this does
          not prove that one <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">minimum
          visibile</span></span> of the insect is not equal to one
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">minimum visibile</span></span> of the man. The
          not distinguishing between the mediate and immediate objects of
          sight is, I suspect, a cause of misapprehension in this matter.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> contains the most
          systematic and reasoned exposition of Berkeley's philosophy, in its
          early stage, which we possess. Like the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span>, its tentative pioneer, it was prepared at
          Trinity College, Dublin. Its author had hardly completed his
          twenty-fifth year when it was published. The first edition of this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“First Part”</span> of the projected
          Treatise, <span class="tei tei-q">“printed by Aaron Rhames, for
          Jeremy Pepyat, bookseller in Skinner Row, Dublin,”</span> appeared
          early in 1710. A second edition, with minor changes, and in which
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Part I”</span> was withdrawn from the
          title-page, was published in London in 1734, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“printed for Jacob Tonson”</span>—on the eve of
          Berkeley's settlement at Cloyne. It was the last in the author's
          lifetime. The projected <span class="tei tei-q">“Second
          Part”</span> of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> was never given to
          the world, and we can hardly conjecture its design. In a letter in
          1729 to his American friend, Samuel Johnson, Berkeley mentions that
          he had <span class="tei tei-q">“made considerable progress on the
          Second Part,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          manuscript,”</span> he adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“was lost
          about fourteen years ago, during my travels in Italy; and I never

          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> appeared in London in

          commentary of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Remarks</span></span> by the anonymous editor,
          on the pages opposite the text, in which, according to the editor,
          Berkeley's doctrines are <span class="tei tei-q">“carefully
          examined, and shewn to be repugnant to fact, and his principles to
          be incompatible with the constitution of human nature and the
          reason and fitness of things.”</span> In this volume the

          Principles</span></span>. The acuteness of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Remarks</span></span>
          is not in proportion to their bulk and diffuseness: many popular
          misconceptions of Berkeley are served up, without appreciation of
          the impotence of matter, and of natural causation as only passive
          sense-symbolism, which is at the root of the theory of the material
          world against which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Remarks</span></span> are directed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Kantian and
          post-Kantian Idealism that is characteristic of the nineteenth
          century has recalled attention to Berkeley, who had produced his
          spiritual philosophy under the prevailing conditions of English
          thought in the preceding age, when Idealism in any form was
          uncongenial. In 1869 the book of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> was translated into
          German, with annotations, by Ueberweg, professor of philosophy at
          Königsberg, the university of Kant. The Clarendon Press edition of
          the Collected Works of Berkeley followed in 1871. In 1874 an
          edition of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, by Dr. Kranth,
          Professor of Philosophy in the university of Pennsylvania, appeared
          in America, with annotations drawn largely from <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Clarendon Press edition and
          Ueberweg. In 1878 Dr. Collyns Simon republished the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, with discussions
          based upon the text, followed by an appendix of remarks on Kant and
          Hume in their relation to Berkeley.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The book of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, as we have it, must
          be taken as a systematic fragment of an incompletely developed
          philosophy. Many years after its appearance, the author thus
          describes the conditions:—<span class="tei tei-q">“It was published
          when I was very young, and without doubt hath many defects. For
          though the notions should be true (as I verily think they are), yet
          it is difficult to express them clearly and consistently, language
          being framed for common use and received prejudices. I do not
          therefore pretend that my books can teach truth. All I hope for is
          that they may be an occasion to inquisitive men of discovering
          truth<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href=
          "#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Again:—<span class="tei tei-q">“I had no inclination to trouble the
          world with large volumes. What I have done was rather with the view
          of giving hints to thinking men, who have leisure and curiosity to
          go to the bottom of things, and pursue them in their own minds. Two
          or three times reading these small tracts (<span class=

          Motu</span></span>), and making what is read the occasion of
          thinking, would, I believe, render the whole familiar and easy to
          the mind, and take off that shocking appearance which hath often
          been observed to attend speculative truths<a id="noteref_468" name=
          "noteref_468" href="#note_468"><span class=

          The incitements to further and deeper thought thus proposed have
          met with a more sympathetic response in this generation than in the
          lifetime of Berkeley.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is
          internal evidence in the book of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> that its author had
          been a diligent and critical student of Locke's <span class=

          Like the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>, it is dedicated to the
          Earl of Pembroke. The word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name=
          "Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> than of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>, although Berkeley
          generally uses it with a narrower application than Locke, confining
          it to phenomena presented objectively to our senses, and their
          subjective reproductions in imagination. With both Berkeley and
          Locke objective phenomena (under the name of ideas) are the
          materials supplied to man for conversion into natural science.
          Locke's reduction of ideas into simple and complex, as well as some
          of his subdivisions, reappear with modifications in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>. Berkeley's account
          of Substance and Power, Space and Time, while different from
          Locke's, still bears marks of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>.
          Concrete Substance, which in its ultimate meaning much perplexes
          Locke, is identified with the personal pronouns <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“you”</span> by
          Berkeley, and is thus spiritualised. Cause proper, or Power, he
          finds only in the voluntary activity of persons. Space is presented
          to us in our sensuous experience of resistance to organic
          movements; while it is symbolised in terms of phenomena presented
          to sight, as already explained in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
          Vision</span></span>. Time is revealed in our actual experience of
          change in the ideas or phenomena of which we are percipient in
          sense; length of time being calculated by the changes in the
          adopted measure of duration. Infinite space and infinite time,
          being necessarily incapable of finite ideation, are dismissed as
          abstractions that for man must always be empty of realisable
          meaning. Indeed, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Commonplace Book</span></span> shews that
          Locke influenced Berkeley as much by antagonism as otherwise.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Such was the candour of that great man
          that I persuade myself, were he alive, he would not be offended
          that I differed from him, seeing that in so doing I follow his
          advice to use my own judgment, see with my own eyes and not with
          another's.”</span> So he argues against Locke's opinions about the
          infinity and eternity of space, and the possibility of matter
          endowed with power to think, and urges his inconsistency in
          treating some qualities <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg
          217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of matter as wholly material, while he insists that others, under
          the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“secondary,”</span> are
          necessarily dependent on sentient intelligence. Above all he
          assails Locke's <span class="tei tei-q">“abstract ideas”</span> as
          germs of scepticism—interpreting Locke's meaning paradoxically.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next to Locke,
          Descartes and Malebranche are prominent in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>. Recognition of the
          ultimate supremacy of Spirit, or the spiritual character of active
          power and the constant agency of God in nature, suggested by
          Descartes, was congenial to Berkeley, but he was opposed to the
          mechanical conception of the universe found in the Cartesian
          physical treatises. That thought is synonymous with existence is a
          formula with which the French philosopher might make him familiar,
          as well as with the assumption that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideas
          only</span></em> are immediate objects of human perception; an
          assumption in which Descartes was followed by Locke, and
          philosophical thinkers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
          but under differing interpretations of the term <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Malebranche
          appears less in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> than Locke and
          Descartes. In early life, at any rate, Berkeley would be less at
          home in the <span class="tei tei-q">“divine vision”</span> of
          Malebranche than among the <span class="tei tei-q">“ideas”</span>
          of Locke. The mysticism of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Recherche de la
          Vérité</span></span> is unlike the transparent lucidity of
          Berkeley's juvenile thought. But the subordinate place and office
          of the material world in Malebranche's system, and his conception
          of power as wholly spiritual, approached the New Principles of
          Berkeley.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plato and
          Aristotle hardly appear, either by name or as characteristic

          of the work, and again more than once in the writings of Berkeley's
          early and middle life, but is significantly withdrawn in his old
          age. In the ardour of youth, his prime remedy for anarchy in
          philosophy, and for the sceptical disposition which philosophy had
          been apt to generate, was suppression of abstract ideas as
          impossible ideas—empty names heedlessly accepted as ideas—an evil
          to be counteracted by steady adherence to the concrete experience
          found in our senses and inner consciousness. Never to lose our hold
          of positive facts, and always to individualise general conceptions,
          are regulative maxims by which Berkeley would make us govern our
          investigation of ultimate problems. He takes up his position in the
          actual universe of applied reason; not in the empty void of
          abstract reason, remote from particulars and succession of change,
          in which no real existence is found. All realisable ideas must be
          either concrete data of sense, or concrete data of inward
          consciousness. It is relations embodied in particular facts, not
          pretended abstract ideas, that give fruitful meaning to common
          terms. Abstract matter, abstract substance, abstract power,
          abstract space, abstract time—unindividualisable in sense or in
          imagination—must all be void of meaning; the issue of unlawful
          analysis, which pretends to find what is real without the concrete
          ideas that make the real, because percipient spirit is the
          indispensable factor of all reality. The only lawful abstraction is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nominal</span></em>—the application, that is
          to say, of a name in common to an indefinite number of things which
          resemble one another. This is Berkeley's <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nominalism.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley takes
          Locke as the representative advocate of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“abstract ideas”</span> against which he wages war in
          the Introduction to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>. Under cover of an
          ambiguity in the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, he is unconsciously fighting
          against a man of straw. He supposes that Locke means by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>
          only a concrete datum of sense, or of imagination; <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and he argues that we cannot without
          contradiction abstract from all such data, and yet retain idea. But
          Locke includes among <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">his</span></em> ideas intellectual
          relations—what Berkeley himself afterwards distinguished as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">notions</span></em>, in contrast with ideas.
          This polemic against Locke is therefore one of verbal confusion. In
          later life he probably saw this, as he saw deeper into the whole
          question involved. This is suggested by the omission of the
          argument against abstract ideas, given in earlier editions of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span>, from the edition
          published a year before he died. In his juvenile attack on
          abstractions, his characteristic impetuosity seems to carry him to
          the extreme of rejecting rational relations that are involved in
          the objectivity of sensible things and natural order, thus resting
          experience at last only on phenomena—particular and contingent.</p>

            Principles.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader may
            remember that one of the entries in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commonplace
            Book</span></span> runs as follows:—<span class="tei tei-q">“To
            begin the First Book, not with mention of sensation and
            reflexion, but, instead of sensation, to use perception, or
            thought in general.”</span> Berkeley seems there to be
            oscillating between Locke and Descartes. He now adopts Locke's
            account of the materials of which our concrete experience
            consists (sect. 1). The data of human knowledge of existence are
            accordingly found in the ideas, phenomena, or appearances
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">a</span></span>) of which we are percipient
            in the senses, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">b</span></span>) of which we are conscious
            when we attend to our inward passions and operations—all which
            make up the original contents of human experience, to be
            reproduced in new forms and arrangements, (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) in
            memory and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">d</span></span>) imagination and
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">e</span></span>) expectation. Those
            materials are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em> because living mind or
            spirit is the indispensable realising factor: they all presuppose
            living mind, spirit, self, or ego to realise and elaborate them
            (sect. 2). This is implied in our use of personal pronouns, which
            signify, not ideas of any of the preceding kinds, but that which
            is <span class="tei tei-q">“entirely distinct from them, wherein
            they exist, or, which is the same thing, by which they are
            perceived.”</span> In this fundamental presupposition Descartes
            is more apparent than Locke, and there is even an unconscious
            forecast of Kant and Hegel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley next
            faces a New Question which his New Principles are intended to
            answer. How is the concrete world that is presented to our senses
            related to Mind or Spirit? Is all or any of its reality
            independent of percipient experience? Is it true that the
            phenomena of which we are percipient in sense are ultimately
            independent of all percipient and conscious life, and are even
            the ultimate basis of all that is real? Must we recognise in the
            phenomena of Matter the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">substance</span></em> of what we call Mind?
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name=
            "Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> For do we not
            find, when we examine Body and Spirit mutually related in our
            personality, that the latter is more dependent on the former, and
            on the physical cosmos of which the former is a part, than our
            body and its bodily surroundings are dependent on Spirit? In
            short, is not the universe of existence, in its final form, only
            lifeless Matter?</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The claim of
            Matter to be supreme is what Berkeley produces his Principles in
            order to reduce. Concrete reality is self-evidently unreal, he
            argues, in the total absence of percipient Spirit, for Spirit is
            the one realising factor. Try to imagine the material world
            unperceived and you are trying to picture empty abstraction.
            Wholly material matter is self-evidently an inconceivable
            absurdity; a universe emptied of all percipient life is an
            impossible universe. The material world becomes real in being
            perceived: it depends for its reality upon the spiritual
            realisation. As colours in a dark room become real with the
            introduction of light, so the material world becomes real in the
            life and agency of Spirit. It must exist in terms of sentient
            life and percipient intelligence, in order to rise into any
            degree of reality that human beings at least can be at all
            concerned with, either speculatively or practically. Matter
            totally abstracted from percipient spirit must go the way of all
            abstract ideas. It is an illusion, concealed by confused thought
            and abuse of words; yet from obvious causes strong enough to
            stifle faith in this latent but self-evident Principle—that the
            universe of sense-presented phenomena can have concrete existence
            only in and by sentient intelligence. It is the reverse of this
            Principle that Berkeley takes to have been <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the chief source of all that scepticism and folly,
            all those contradictions and inexplicable puzzling absurdities,
            that have in all ages been a reproach to human reason<a id=
            "noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a>.”</span>
            And indeed, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg
            222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            when it is fully understood, it is seen in its own light to be
            the chief of <span class="tei tei-q">“those truths which are so
            near and obvious to the mind, that a man need only open his eyes
            to see them. For such I take this important one to be—that all
            the choir of heaven and furniture of the Earth, in a word, all
            those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world, have
            not any subsistence without a Mind”</span> (sect. 6). Living Mind
            or Spirit is the indispensable factor of all realities that are
            presented to our senses, including, of course, our own
            bodies.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet this
            Principle, notwithstanding its intuitive certainty, needs to be
            evoked by reflection from the latency in which it lies concealed,
            in the confused thought of the unreflecting. It is only
            gradually, and with the help of reasoning, that the world
            presented to the senses is distinctly recognised in this its
            deepest and truest reality. And even when we see that the
            phenomena <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">immediately</span></em> presented to our
            senses need to be realised in percipient experience, in order to
            be concretely real, we are ready to ask whether there may not be
            substances <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">like</span></em> the things so presented,
            which can exist <span class="tei tei-q">“without mind,”</span> or
            in a wholly material way (sect. 8). Nay, are there not <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em>
            of the phenomena immediately presented to our senses which do not
            need living mind to make them real? It is allowed by Locke and
            others that all those qualities of matter which are called
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">secondary</span></em> cannot be wholly
            material, and that living mind is indispensable for <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em>
            realisation in nature; but Locke and the rest argue, that this is
            not so with the qualities which they call <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">primary</span></em>, and which they regard
            as of the essence of matter. Colours, sounds, tastes, smells are
            all allowed to be not wholly material; but are not the size,
            shape, situation, solidity, and motion of bodies qualities that
            are real without need for the realising agency of any Mind or
            Spirit in the universe, and which would continue to be what they
            are now if all Spirit, divine or human, ceased to
            exist?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
            223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            supposition that some of the phenomena of what is called Matter
            can be real, and yet wholly material, is discussed in sections
            9-15, in which it is argued that the things of sense cannot exist
            really, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">any</span></em> of their manifestations,
            unless they are brought into reality in some percipient life and
            experience. It is held impossible that any quality of matter can
            have the reality which we all attribute to it, unless it is
            spiritually realised (sect. 15).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But may Matter
            not be real apart from all its so-called qualities, these being
            allowed to be not wholly material, because real only within
            percipient spirit? May not this wholly material Matter be
            Something that, as it were, exists <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">behind</span></em> the ideas, phenomena, or
            qualities that make their appearance to human beings? This
            question, Berkeley would say, is a meaningless and wholly
            unpractical one. Material substance that makes and can make no
            real appearance—unphenomenal or unideal—stripped of all its
            qualities—is only <span class="tei tei-q">“another name for
            abstract Being,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the abstract
            idea of Being appeareth to me the most incomprehensible of all
            other. When I consider the two parts or branches which make up
            the words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">material substance</span></em>, I am
            convinced there is no distinct meaning annexed to them”</span>
            (sect. 17). Neither Sense nor Reason inform us of the existence
            of real material substances that exist <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">abstractly</span></em>, or out of all
            relation to the secondary and primary qualities of which we are
            percipient when we exercise our senses. By our senses we cannot
            perceive more than ideas or phenomena, aggregated as individual
            things that are presented to us: we cannot perceive substances
            that make no appearance in sense. Then as for reason, unrealised
            substances, abstracted from living Spirit, human or divine, being
            altogether meaningless, can in no way explain the concrete
            realisations of human experience. In short, if there are wholly
            unphenomenal material substances, it is impossible that we should
            ever discover <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg
            224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            them, or have any concern with them, speculative or practical;
            and if there are not, we should have the same reason to assert
            that there are which we have now (sect. 20). It is impossible to
            put any meaning into wholly abstract reality. <span class=

            or nothing at all”</span> (sect. 24).</p>

            satisfied that the whole natural world is only the passive
            instrument and expression of Spiritual Power we are asked to

            supposing that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">they</span></em> can be active causes,
            either of the changes that are continuously in progress among
            themselves, or of the feelings, perceptions, and volitions of
            which spiritual beings are conscious. We find the ideas or
            phenomena that pass in procession before our senses related to
            one another as signs to their meanings, in a cosmical order that
            virtually makes the material world a language and a prophecy: but
            this cosmical procession is not found to originate in the ideas
            or phenomena themselves, and there is reason for supposing it to
            be maintained by ever-living Spirit, which thus not only
            substantiates the things of sense, but explains their laws of
            motion and their movements.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the
            universe of reality is not exclusively One Spirit. Experience
            contradicts the supposition. I find <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> on trial that my personal power to produce
            changes in the ideas or phenomena which my senses present to me
            is a limited power (sect. 28-33). I can make and unmake my own
            fancies, but I cannot with like freedom make and unmake
            presentations of sense. When in daylight I open my eyes, it is
            not in my power to determine whether I shall see or not; nor is
            it in my power to determine what objects I shall see. The
            cosmical order of sense-phenomena is independent of my will. When
            I employ my senses, I find myself always confronted by sensible
            signs of perfect Reason and omnipresent Will. But I also awake in
            the faith that I am an individual person. And the sense-symbolism
            of which the material world consists, while it keeps me in
            constant and immediate relation to the Universal Spirit, whose
            language it is, keeps me likewise in intercourse with other
            persons, akin to myself, who are signified to me by their overt
            actions and articulate words, which enter into my sensuous
            experience. Sense-given phenomena thus, among their other
            instrumental offices, are the medium of communication between
            human beings, who by this means can find companions, and make
            signs to them. So while, at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">our</span></em> highest point of view,
            Nature is Spirit, experience shews that there is room in the
            universe for a plurality of persons, individual, and in a measure
            free or morally responsible. If Berkeley does not say all this,
            his New Principles tend thus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At any rate,
            in his reasoned exposition of his Principles he is anxious to
            distinguish those phenomena that are presented to the senses of
            all mankind from the private ideas or fancies of individual men
            (sect. 28-33). The former constitute the world which sentient
            beings realise in common. He calls them <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>
            because they are unrealisable without percipient mind; but still
            on the understanding that they are not to be confounded with the
            chimeras of imagination. They are more deeply and truly real than
            chimeras. The groups in which they are found <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id=
            "Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to coexist are the individual
            things of sense, whose fixed order of succession exemplifies what
            we call natural law, or natural causation: the correlation of
            their changes to our pleasures and pains, desires and aversions,
            makes scientific knowledge of their laws practically important to
            the life of man, in his embodied state.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the
            real ideas presented to our senses, unlike those of imagination,
            Berkeley would imply, cannot be either representative or
            misrepresentative. Our imagination may mislead us: the original
            data of sense cannot: although we may, and often do, misinterpret
            their relations to one another, and to our pleasures and pains
            and higher faculties. The divine meaning with which they are
            charged, of which science is a partial expression, they may
            perhaps be said to represent. Otherwise representative
            sense-perception is absurdity: the ideas of sense cannot be
            representative in the way those of imagination are; for fancies
            are faint representations of data of sense. The appearances that
            sentient intelligence realises <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em>
            the things of sense, and we cannot go deeper. If we prefer
            accordingly to call the material world a dream or a chimera, we
            must understand that it is the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">reasonable</span></em> dream in which all
            sentient intelligence participates, and by which the embodied
            life of man must be regulated.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Has Berkeley,
            in his juvenile ardour, and with the impetuosity natural to him,
            while seeking to demonstrate the impotence of matter, and the
            omnipresent supremacy of Spirit, so spiritualised the material
            world as to make it unfit for the symbolical office in the
            universe of reality which he supposes it to discharge? Is its
            potential existence in God, and its percipient realisation by me,
            and presumably by innumerable other sentient beings, an adequate
            account of the real material world existing in place and time?
            Can this universal orderly dream experienced in sense involve the

            with a means of escape from absolute solitude? Nay, if Matter
            cannot rise into reality without percipient spirit as realising

            Matter? Without intelligent life Matter is pronounced unreal. But
            is it not also true that without Matter, and the special material
            organism we call our body, percipient spirit is unreal? Does not
            Nature seem as indispensable to Spirit as Spirit is to Nature?
            Must we not assume at least their unbeginning and unending
            coexistence, even if we recognise in Spirit the deeper and truer
            reality? Do the New Principles explain the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em>
            ground of trust and certainty about the universe of change into
            which I entered as a stranger when I was born? If they make all
            that I have believed in as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          of attention and thought which the subject-matter shall seem to
          deserve. For, as there are some passages that, taken by themselves,
          are very liable (nor could it be remedied) to gross
          misinterpretation, and to be charged with most absurd consequences,
          which, nevertheless, upon an entire perusal will appear not to

          greater clearness and evidence of knowledge, and be less disturbed

          meditate, and reflect on the nature of things, but a thousand

          It is a hard thing to suppose that right deductions from true
          principles should ever end in consequences which cannot be
          maintained or made consistent. We should believe that God has dealt
          more bountifully with the sons of men than to give them a strong
          desire for that knowledge which he had placed quite out of their
          reach. This were not agreeable to the wonted indulgent methods of
          Providence, which, whatever appetites it may have implanted in the
          creatures, doth usually furnish them with such means as, if rightly
          made use of, will not fail to satisfy them. Upon the whole, I am
          inclined to think that the far greater part, if not all, of those
          difficulties which have hitherto amused philosophers, and blocked
          up the way to knowledge, are entirely owing to ourselves. We have
          first raised a dust, and then complain we cannot see.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. My purpose
          therefore is, to try if I can discover what those Principles are
          which have introduced all that doubtfulness and uncertainty, those
          absurdities and contradictions, into the several sects of
          philosophy; insomuch that the wisest men have thought our ignorance
          incurable, conceiving it to arise from the natural dulness and
          limitation of our faculties. And surely it is a work well deserving
          our pains to make a strict inquiry concerning the First

          Knowledge; to sift and examine them on all sides: especially since
          there may be some grounds to suspect that those lets and
          difficulties, which stay and embarrass the mind in its search after
          truth, do not spring from any darkness and intricacy in the
          objects, or natural defect in the understanding, so much as from
          false Principles which have been insisted on, and might have been
          avoided.</p>

          I am not without some hopes; upon the consideration that the
          largest views are not always the clearest, and that he who is
          short-sighted will be obliged to draw the object nearer, and may,
          perhaps, by a close and narrow survey, discern that which had

          prepare the mind of the reader for the easier conceiving what
          follows, it is proper to premise somewhat, by way of Introduction,
          concerning the nature and abuse of Language. But the unravelling
          this matter leads me in some measure to anticipate my design, by
          taking notice of what seems to have had a chief part in rendering
          speculation intricate and perplexed, and to have occasioned
          innumerable errors and difficulties in almost all parts of
          knowledge. And that is the opinion that the mind hath a power of
          framing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          acknowledge that no small part of them are spent about abstract
          ideas. These are in a more especial manner thought to be the object
          of those sciences which go by the name of logic and metaphysics,
          and of all that which passes under the notion of the most
          abstracted and sublime learning; in all which one shall scarce find
          any question handled in such a manner as does not suppose their
          existence in the mind, and that it is well acquainted with
          them.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            <hr style="width: 50%" />
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. It is agreed
          on all hands that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">qualities</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modes</span></em>
          of things do never really exist each of them apart by itself, and
          separated from all others, but are mixed, as it were, and blended
          together, several in the same object. But, we are told, the mind,
          being able to consider each quality singly, or abstracted from
          those other qualities with which it is united, does by that means
          frame to itself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstract ideas</span></em>. For example, there
          is conceived by sight an object extended, coloured, and moved: this
          mixed or compound idea the mind resolving into its simple,
          constituent parts, and viewing each by itself, exclusive of the
          rest, does frame the abstract ideas of extension, colour, and
          motion. Not that it is possible for colour or motion to exist
          without extension; but only that the mind can frame to itself by
          abstraction the idea of colour exclusive of extension, and of
          motion exclusive of both colour and extension.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">8. Again, the
          mind having observed that in the particular extensions perceived by
          sense there is something common and alike in all, and some other
          things peculiar, as this or that figure or magnitude, which
          distinguish them one from another, it considers apart, or singles
          out by itself, that which is common; making thereof a most abstract
          idea of extension; which is neither line, surface, nor solid, nor
          has any figure or magnitude, but is an idea entirely prescinded
          from all these. So likewise the mind, by leaving out of the
          particular colours perceived by sense that which distinguishes them
          one from another, and retaining that only which is common to all,
          makes an idea of colour in abstract; which is neither red, nor
          blue, nor white, nor any other determinate colour. And, in like
          manner, by considering motion abstractedly, not only from the body
          moved, but likewise from the figure it describes, and all
          particular directions and velocities, the abstract idea of motion
          is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name=
          "Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> framed; which
          equally corresponds to all particular motions whatsoever that may
          be perceived by sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">9. And as the
          mind frames to itself abstract ideas of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">qualities</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modes</span></em>,
          so does it, by the same precision, or mental separation, attain
          abstract ideas of the more compounded <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beings</span></em>
          which include several coexistent qualities. For example, the mind
          having observed that Peter, James, and John resemble each other in
          certain common agreements of shape and other qualities, leaves out
          of the complex or compound idea it has of Peter, James, and any
          other particular man, that which is peculiar to each, retaining
          only what is common to all, and so makes an abstract idea, wherein
          all the particulars equally partake; abstracting entirely from and
          cutting off all those circumstances and differences which might
          determine it to any particular existence. And after this manner it
          is said we come by the abstract idea of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em>,
          or, if you please, humanity, or human nature; wherein it is true
          there is included colour, because there is no man but has some
          colour, but then it can be neither white, nor black, nor any
          particular colour, because there is no one particular colour
          wherein all men partake. So likewise there is included stature, but
          then it is neither tall stature, nor low stature, nor yet middle
          stature, but something abstracted from all these. And so of the
          rest. Moreover, there being a great variety of other creatures that
          partake in some parts, but not all, of the complex idea of man, the
          mind, leaving out those parts which are peculiar to men, and
          retaining those only which are common to all the living creatures,
          frames the idea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">animal</span></em>; which abstracts not only
          from all particular men, but also all birds, beasts, fishes, and
          insects. The constituent parts of the abstract idea of animal are
          body, life, sense, and spontaneous motion. By <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">body</span></em> is
          meant body without any particular shape or figure, there being no
          one shape or figure common to all animals; without covering, either
          of hair, or feathers, or scales, &amp;c., nor yet naked: hair,
          feathers, scales, and nakedness being the distinguishing properties
          of particular animals, and for that reason left out of the abstract
          idea. Upon the same account, the spontaneous motion must be neither
          walking, nor flying, nor creeping; it is nevertheless a motion, but
          what that motion is it is not easy to conceive.</p><span class=

          imagining or representing to myself, the ideas of those particular
          things I have perceived, and of variously compounding and dividing
          them. I can imagine a man with two heads; or the upper parts of a
          man joined to the body of a horse. I can consider the hand, the
          eye, the nose, each by itself abstracted or separated from the rest
          of the body. But then whatever hand or eye I imagine<a id=
          "noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a>, it
          must have some particular shape and colour. Likewise the idea of
          man that I frame to myself must be either of a white, or a black,
          or a tawny, a straight, or a crooked, a tall, or a low, or a
          middle-sized man. I cannot by any effort of thought conceive the
          abstract idea above described. And it is equally impossible for me
          to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving,
          and which is neither swift nor slow, curvilinear nor rectilinear;
          and the like may be said of all other abstract general ideas
          whatsoever. To be plain, I own myself able to abstract in one
          sense, as when I consider some particular parts or qualities
          separated from others, with which, though they are united in some
          object, yet it is possible they may really exist without them. But
          I deny that I can abstract from one another, or conceive
          separately, those qualities which it is impossible should exist so
          separated; or that I can frame a general notion, by abstracting
          from particulars in the manner aforesaid—which last are the two
          proper acceptations of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstraction</span></em>. And there is ground
          to think most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case. The
          generality of men which are simple and illiterate never pretend to

          no doubt, has given it very much countenance, by seeming to think
          the having abstract general ideas is what puts the widest
          difference in point of understanding betwixt man and beast.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The having of general ideas,”</span> saith
          he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is that which puts a perfect
          distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an excellency which the
          faculties of brutes do by no means attain unto. For it is evident
          we observe no foot-steps in them of making use of general signs for
          universal ideas; from which we have reason to imagine that they
          have not the faculty of abstracting, or making general ideas, since
          they have no use of words, or any other general signs.”</span> And
          a little after:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore, I think, we may
          suppose, that it is in this that the species of brutes are
          discriminated from man: and it is that proper difference wherein
          they are wholly separated, and which at last widens to so wide a
          distance. For if they have any ideas at all, and are not bare

          cannot deny them to have some reason. It seems as evident to me
          that they do, some of them, in certain instances, reason, as that
          they have sense; but it is only in particular ideas, just as they
          receive them from their senses. They are the best of them tied up
          within those narrow bounds, and have not (as I think) the faculty
          to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on Human
          Understanding</span></span>, B. II. ch. 11. § 10 and 11. I readily
          agree with this learned author, that the faculties of brutes can by
          no means attain to abstraction. But then if this be made the
          distinguishing property of that sort <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of animals, I fear a great many of those that
          pass for men must be reckoned into their number. The reason that is
          here assigned, why we have no grounds to think brutes have abstract
          general ideas, is, that we observe in them no use of words, or any
          other general signs; which is built on this supposition, to wit,
          that the making use of words implies having general ideas. From
          which it follows that men who use language are able to abstract or
          generalize their ideas. That this is the sense and arguing of the
          author will further appear by his answering the question he in
          another place puts: <span class="tei tei-q">“Since all things that
          exist are only particulars, how come we by general terms?”</span>
          His answer is: <span class="tei tei-q">“Words become general by
          being made the signs of general ideas.”</span>—<span class=

          becomes general by being made the sign, not of an abstract general
          idea, but of several particular ideas, any one of which it
          indifferently suggests to the mind. For example, when it is said
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the change of motion is proportional to
          the impressed force,”</span> or that <span class=

          propositions are to be understood of motion and extension in

          motion without a body moved, or any determinate direction and

          particular motion I consider, whether it be swift or slow,
          perpendicular, horizontal, or oblique, or in whatever object, the
          axiom concerning it holds equally true. As does the other of every

          are any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstract general ideas</span></em>. For, in
          the passages we have quoted wherein there is mention of general
          ideas, it is always supposed that they are formed by abstraction,
          after the manner set forth in sections 8 and 9<a id="noteref_494"
          name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a>. Now,
          if we will annex a meaning to our words, and speak only of what we
          can conceive, I believe we shall acknowledge that an idea, which
          considered in itself is particular, becomes general, by being made
          to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same
          sort<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href=
          "#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a>. To
          make this plain by an example. Suppose a geometrician is
          demonstrating the method of cutting a line in two equal parts. He
          draws, for instance, a black line of an inch in length: this, which
          in itself is a particular line, is nevertheless <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with regard to its
          signification</span></em> general; since, as it is there used, it
          represents all particular lines whatsoever; so that what is
          demonstrated of it is demonstrated of all lines, or, in other
          words, of a line in general<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496"
          href="#note_496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">496</span></span></a>. And,
          as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that
          particular line</span></em> becomes general by being made a sign,
          so the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">name</span></em> line, which taken absolutely
          is particular, by being a sign, is made general. And as the former
          owes its generality, not to its being the sign of an abstract or
          general line, but of all particular right lines that may possibly
          exist, so the latter must be thought to derive its generality from
          the same cause, namely, the various particular lines which it
          indifferently denotes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">13. To give the
          reader a yet clearer view of the nature of abstract ideas, and the
          uses they are thought necessary to, I shall add one more passage
          out of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay on Human Understanding</span></span>,
          which is as follows:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Abstract ideas are
          not so obvious or easy to children, or the yet unexercised mind, as
          particular ones. If they seem so to grown men, it is only because
          by constant and familiar use <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> they are made so. For, when we nicely reflect
          upon them, we shall find that general ideas are fictions and
          contrivances of the mind, that carry difficulty with them, and do
          not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine. For
          example, does it not require some pains and skill to form the
          general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract,
          comprehensive, and difficult); for it must be neither oblique nor
          rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon; but all
          and none of these at once? In effect, it is something imperfect,
          that cannot exist; an idea<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497"

          wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are
          put together. It is true the mind, in this imperfect state, has
          need of such ideas, and makes all the haste to them it can, for the
          conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge; to both
          which it is naturally very much inclined. But yet one has reason to
          suspect such ideas are marks of our imperfection. At least this is
          enough to shew that the most abstract and general ideas are not
          those that the mind is first and most easily acquainted with, nor
          such as its earliest knowledge is conversant about.”</span>—B. iv.
          ch. 7. § 9. If any man has the faculty of framing in his mind such
          an idea of a triangle as is here described, it is in vain to
          pretend to dispute him out of it, nor would I go about it. All I
          desire is that the reader would fully and certainly inform himself
          whether he has such an idea or no. And this, methinks, can be no
          hard task for any one to perform. What more easy than for any one
          to look a little into his own thoughts, and there try whether he
          has, or can attain to have, an idea that shall correspond with the
          description that is here given of the general idea of a
          triangle—which is neither oblique nor rectangle, equilateral,
          equicrural nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">14. Much is here
          said of the difficulty that abstract ideas carry with them, and the
          pains and skill requisite to the forming them. And it is on all
          hands agreed that there is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          emancipate our thoughts from particular objects, and raise them to
          those sublime speculations that are conversant about abstract
          ideas. From all which the natural consequence should seem to be,
          that so difficult a thing as the forming abstract ideas was not
          necessary for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          and familiar to all sorts of men. But, we are told, if they seem
          obvious and easy to grown men, it is only because by constant and
          familiar use they are made so. Now, I would fain know at what time
          it is men are employed in surmounting that difficulty, and
          furnishing themselves with those necessary helps for discourse. It
          cannot be when they are grown up; for then it seems they are not
          conscious of any such painstaking. It remains therefore to be the
          business of their childhood. And surely the great and multiplied
          labour of framing abstract notions<a id="noteref_498" name=

          be found a hard task for that tender age. Is it not a hard thing to
          imagine that a couple of children cannot prate together of their
          sugar-plums and rattles and the rest of their little trinkets, till
          they have first tacked together numberless inconsistencies, and so
          framed in their minds abstract general ideas, and annexed them to
          every common name they make use of?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">15. Nor do I

          point much insisted on, that all knowledge and demonstration are
          about universal notions, to which I fully agree. But then it does
          not appear to me that those notions are formed by abstraction in
          the manner premised—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          comprehend, not consisting in the absolute, positive nature or
          conception of anything, but in the relation it bears to the
          particulars signified or represented by it; by virtue whereof it is

          "Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> universal idea of a

          triangle which was neither equilateral, nor scalenon, nor
          equicrural; but only that the particular triangle I consider,
          whether of this or that sort it matters not, doth equally stand for
          and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever, and is in that
          sense universal. All which seems very plain and not to include any
          difficulty in it<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">16. But here it
          will be demanded, how we can know any proposition to be true of all
          particular triangles, except we have first seen it demonstrated of
          the abstract idea of a triangle which equally agrees to all? For,
          because a property may be demonstrated to agree to some one
          particular triangle, it will not thence follow that it equally
          belongs to any other triangle which in all respects is not the same
          with it. For example, having demonstrated that the three angles of
          an isosceles rectangular triangle are equal to two right ones, I
          cannot therefore conclude this affection agrees to all other
          triangles which have neither a right angle nor two equal sides. It
          seems therefore that, to be certain this proposition is universally
          true, we must either make a particular demonstration for every
          particular triangle, which is impossible; or once for all
          demonstrate it of the abstract idea of a triangle, in which all the
          particulars do indifferently partake, and by which they are all
          equally represented. To which I answer, that, though the idea I
          have in view<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href=
          "#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a>
          whilst I make the demonstration be, for instance, that of an
          isosceles rectangular triangle whose sides are of a determinate
          length, I may nevertheless be certain it extends to all other
          rectilinear triangles, of what sort or bigness soever. And that
          because neither the right angle, nor the equality, nor determinate
          length of the sides are at all concerned in the demonstration. It
          is true the diagram I have in view includes all these particulars;
          but then there is not the least mention made of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em> in
          the proof of the proposition. It is not said the three angles are
          equal to two right ones, because one of them is a right
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name=
          "Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> angle, or because
          the sides comprehending it are of the same length. Which
          sufficiently shews that the right angle might have been oblique,
          and the sides unequal, and for all that the demonstration have held
          good. And for this reason it is that I conclude that to be true of
          any obliquangular or scalenon which I had demonstrated of a
          particular right-angled equicrural triangle, and not because I
          demonstrated the proposition of the abstract idea of a triangle.

          here it must be acknowledged that a man may <em class=

          a triangle. In like manner we may consider Peter so far forth as
          man, or so far forth as animal, without framing the forementioned
          abstract idea, either of man or of animal; inasmuch as all that is
          perceived is not considered.]</p>

          endless as well as an useless thing to trace the Schoolmen, those
          great masters of abstraction, through all the manifold inextricable
          labyrinths of error and dispute which their doctrine of abstract
          natures and notions seems to have led them into. What bickerings
          and controversies, and what a learned dust have been raised about
          those matters, and what mighty advantage has been from thence

          need being insisted on. And it had been well if the ill effects of
          that doctrine were confined to those only who make the most avowed
          profession of it. When men consider the great pains, industry, and

          uncertainty, and disputes that are like never to have an end; and
          even those that are thought to be supported by the most clear and
          cogent demonstrations contain in them paradoxes which are perfectly
          irreconcilable to the understandings of men; and that, taking all
          together, a very small portion of them does supply any real benefit

          to consider the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">source</span></em> of this prevailing notion,
          and that seems to me to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          less extent than reason itself could have been the source of an
          opinion so universally received. The truth of this appears as from
          other reasons so also from the plain confession of the ablest
          patrons of abstract ideas, who acknowledge that they are made in
          order to naming; from which it is clear consequence that if there
          had been no such thing as speech or universal signs, there never
          had been any thought of abstraction. See B. iii. ch. 6. § 39, and
          elsewhere of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Understanding</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us examine
          the manner wherein Words have contributed to the origin of that
          mistake.—First then, it is thought that every name has, or ought to
          have, one only precise and settled signification; which inclines
          men to think there are certain abstract determinate ideas that
          constitute the true and only immediate signification of each
          general name; and that it is by the mediation of these abstract
          ideas that a general name comes to signify any particular thing.
          Whereas, in truth, there is no such thing as one precise and
          definite signification annexed to any general name, they all
          signifying indifferently a great number of particular ideas. All
          which does evidently follow from what has been already said, and
          will clearly appear to any one by a little reflexion. To this it
          will be objected that every name that has a definition is thereby
          restrained to one certain signification. For example, a triangle is
          defined to be <span class="tei tei-q">“a plain surface comprehended
          by three right lines”</span>; by which that name is limited to
          denote one certain idea and no other. To which I answer, that in
          the definition it is not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg
          251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          said whether the surface be great or small, black or white, nor
          whether the sides are long or short, equal or unequal, nor with
          what angles they are inclined to each other; in all which there may
          be great variety, and consequently there is no one settled idea
          which limits the signification of the word triangle. It is one
          thing for to keep a name constantly to the same <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">definition</span></em>, and another to make it
          stand everywhere for the same <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em><a id="noteref_506" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          one is necessary, the other useless and impracticable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">19. But, to give
          a farther account how words came to produce the doctrine of
          abstract ideas, it must be observed that it is a received opinion
          that language has no other end but the communicating ideas, and
          that every significant name stands for an idea. This being so, and
          it being withal certain that names which yet are not thought
          altogether insignificant do not always mark out particular
          conceivable ideas, it is straightway concluded that they stand for
          abstract notions. That there are many names in use amongst
          speculative men which do not always suggest to others determinate,
          particular ideas, or in truth anything at all, is what nobody will
          deny. And a little attention will discover that it is not necessary
          (even in the strictest reasonings) that significant names which
          stand for ideas should, every time they are used, excite in the
          understanding the ideas they are made to stand for: in reading and

          communicating of ideas marked by words is not the chief and only
          end of language, as is commonly supposed. There are other ends, as
          the raising of some passion, the exciting to or deterring from an
          action, the putting the mind in some particular disposition; to
          which the former is in many cases barely subservient, and sometimes
          entirely omitted, when these can be obtained without <span class=

          unfrequently happen in the familiar use of language. I entreat the
          reader to reflect with himself, and see if it doth not often
          happen, either in hearing or reading a discourse, that the passions
          of fear, love, hatred, admiration, and disdain, and the like, arise
          immediately in his mind upon the perception of certain words,
          without any ideas<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href=

          coming between. At first, indeed, the words might have occasioned
          ideas that were fitting to produce those emotions; but, if I
          mistake not, it will be found that, when language is once grown
          familiar, the hearing of the sounds or sight of the characters is
          oft immediately attended with those passions which at first were
          wont to be produced by the intervention of ideas that are now quite
          omitted. May we not, for example, be affected with the promise of a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good
          thing</span></em>, though we have not an idea of what it is? Or is
          not the being threatened with danger sufficient to excite a dread,
          though we think not of any particular evil likely to befal us, nor
          yet frame to ourselves an idea of danger in abstract? If any one
          shall join ever so little reflection of his own to what has been
          said, I believe that it will evidently appear to him that general
          names are often used in the propriety of language without the
          speakers designing them for marks of ideas in his own, which he
          would have them raise in the mind of the hearer. Even proper names
          themselves do not seem always spoken with a design to bring into
          our view the ideas of those individuals that are supposed to be
          marked by them. For example, when a schoolman tells me <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Aristotle hath said it,”</span> all I conceive he
          means by it is to dispose me to embrace his opinion with the
          deference and submission which custom has annexed to that name. And
          this effect may be so instantly produced in the minds of those who
          are accustomed to resign their judgment to authority of that
          philosopher, as it is impossible any idea either of his person,
          writings, or reputation should go before. [<a id="noteref_510"

          Innumerable examples of this kind may be given, but why should I

          whatever ideas I consider, I shall endeavour to take them bare and
          naked into my view; keeping out of my thoughts, so far as I am
          able, those names which long and constant use hath so strictly
          united with them. From which I may expect to derive the following
          advantages:—</p>

          I shall be sure to get clear of all controversies purely verbal,
          the springing up of which weeds in almost all the sciences has been
          a main hindrance to the growth of true and sound knowledge.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em>, this seems to be a sure
          way to extricate myself out of that fine and subtle net
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name=
          "Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of abstract ideas,
          which has so miserably perplexed and entangled the minds of men;
          and that with this peculiar circumstance, that by how much the
          finer and more curious was the wit of any man, by so much the
          deeper was he likely to be ensnared and faster held therein.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          divested of words, I do not see how I can easily be mistaken. The
          objects I consider, I clearly and adequately know. I cannot be
          deceived in thinking I have an idea which I have not. It is not
          possible for me to imagine that any of my own ideas are alike or
          unlike that are not truly so. To discern the agreements or
          disagreements there are between my ideas, to see what ideas are
          included in any compound idea and what not, there is nothing more
          requisite than an attentive perception of what passes in my own
          understanding.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">23. But the
          attainment of all these advantages does presuppose an entire
          deliverance from the deception of words; which I dare hardly
          promise myself, so difficult a thing it is to dissolve an union so
          early begun, and confirmed by so long a habit as that betwixt words
          and ideas. Which difficulty seems to have been very much increased
          by the doctrine of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstraction</span></em>. For, so long as men
          thought <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstract</span></em> ideas were annexed to
          their words, it does not seem strange that they should use words
          for ideas; it being found an impracticable thing to lay aside the
          word, and retain the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstract</span></em> idea in the mind; which
          in itself was perfectly inconceivable. This seems to me the
          principal cause why those who have so emphatically recommended to
          others the laying aside all use of words in their meditations, and
          contemplating their bare ideas, have yet failed to perform it
          themselves. Of late many have been very sensible of the absurd
          opinions and insignificant disputes which grow out of the abuse of
          words. And, in order to remedy these evils, they advise well<a id=
          "noteref_517" name="noteref_517" href="#note_517"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a>, that
          we attend to the ideas signified, and draw off our attention from
          the words which signify them<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518"
          href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> But, how good soever
          this advice may be they have given others, it is plain they could
          not have a due regard to it themselves, so long as they thought the
          only immediate use of words was to signify ideas, and that the
          immediate signification of every general name was a determinate
          abstract idea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">24. But these
          being known to be mistakes, a man may with greater ease prevent his

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          himself in vain to find out and conceive the <em class=

          spare himself the labour of looking for ideas where there are none
          to be had. It were, therefore, to be wished that every one would
          use his utmost endeavours to obtain a clear view of the ideas he
          would consider; separating from them all that dress and incumbrance
          of words which so much contribute to blind the judgment and divide
          the attention. In vain do we extend our view into the heavens and
          pry into the entrails of the earth, in vain do we consult the
          writings of learned men and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity.
          We need only draw the curtain of words, to behold the fairest tree
          of knowledge, whose fruit is excellent, and within the reach of our
          hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">25. Unless we
          take care to clear the First Principles of Knowledge from the
          embarras and delusion of Words, we may make infinite reasonings
          upon them to no purpose; we may draw consequences from
          consequences, and be never the wiser. The farther we go, we shall
          only lose ourselves the more irrecoverably, and be the deeper

          reading that I had in writing them. By this means it will be easy
          for him to discover the truth or falsity of what I say. He will be
          out of all danger of being deceived by my words. And I do not see

          as easily divide a thing from itself. I may, indeed, divide in my

          perhaps I never perceived by sense so divided. Thus, I imagine the
          trunk of a human body without the limbs, or conceive the smell of a
          rose without thinking on the rose itself. So far, I will not deny,
          I can abstract; if that may properly be called <em class=

          existence or perception. Hence, as it is impossible for me to see

          they take for an undoubted truth, which they can demonstrate beyond
          all exception. Now, if it be certain that those <em class=

          united with the other sensible qualities, and not, even in thought,
          capable of being abstracted from them, it plainly follows that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          desire any one to reflect, and try whether he can, by any

          without all other sensible qualities. For my own part, I see
          evidently that it is not in my power to frame an idea of a body
          extended and moving, but I must withal give it some colour or other
          sensible quality, which is acknowledged to exist only in the mind.
          In short, extension, figure and motion, abstracted from all other
          qualities, are inconceivable. Where therefore the other sensible
          qualities are, there must these be also, to wit, in the mind and
          nowhere else<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href=

          the organs of sense varies. The extension therefore which exists
          without the mind is neither great nor small, the motion neither
          swift nor slow; that is, they are nothing at all. But, say you,
          they are extension in general, and motion in general. Thus we see
          how much the tenet of extended moveable substances existing without

          conceived: since therefore it has been shewn that extension exists
          not in an unthinking substance, the same must also be true of
          solidity<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href=

          though the other qualities be allowed to exist without, will be
          evident to whoever considers that the same thing bears a different
          denomination of number as the mind views it with different
          respects. Thus, the same extension is one, or three, or thirty-six,
          according as the mind considers it with reference to a yard, a
          foot, or an inch. Number is so visibly relative, and dependent on
          men's understanding, that it is strange to think how any one should
          give it an absolute existence without the mind. We say one book,

          methinks I could not miss finding it; on the contrary, it should be

          idea</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">14. I shall
          farther add, that, after the same manner as modern philosophers
          prove certain sensible qualities to have no existence in Matter, or
          without the mind, the same thing may be likewise proved of all
          other sensible qualities whatsoever. Thus, for instance, it is said
          that heat and cold are affections only of the mind, and not at all
          patterns of real beings, existing in the corporeal substances which
          excite them; for that the same body which appears cold to one hand
          seems warm to another. Now, why may we not as well argue that
          figure and extension are not patterns or resemblances of qualities
          existing in Matter; because to the same eye at different stations,
          or eyes of a different texture at the same station, they appear
          various, and cannot therefore be the images of anything settled and
          determinate without the mind? Again, it is proved that sweetness is
          not really in the sapid thing; because the thing remaining
          unaltered the sweetness is changed into bitter, as in case of a
          fever or otherwise vitiated palate. Is it not as reasonable to say
          that motion is not without the mind; since if the succession of
          ideas in the mind become swifter, the motion, it is acknowledged,
          shall appear slower, without any alteration in any external
          object<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href=
          "#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">15. In short,
          let any one consider those arguments which are thought manifestly
          to prove that colours and tastes exist only in the mind, and he
          shall find they may with equal force be brought to prove the same
          thing of extension, figure, and motion. Though it must be confessed
          this method of arguing does not so much prove that there is no
          extension or colour in an outward object, as that we do not know by
          sense which is the true extension or colour of the object. But the
          arguments foregoing<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href=

          plainly shew it to be impossible that any colour or extension at
          all, or other sensible quality whatsoever, should exist in an

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">16. But let us
          examine a little the received opinion. It is said extension is a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          Matter is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          desire that you would explain to me what is meant by Matter's
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">supporting</span></em> extension. Say you, I
          have no idea of Matter; and therefore cannot explain it. I answer,
          though you have no positive, yet, if you have any meaning at all,
          you must at least have a relative idea of Matter; though you know
          not what it is, yet you must be supposed to know what relation it
          bears to accidents, and what is meant by its supporting them. It is
          evident <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">support</span></em> cannot here be taken in
          its usual or literal sense, as when we say that pillars support a
          building. In what sense therefore must it be taken? [<a id=

          my part, I am not able to discover any sense at all that can be
          applicable to it.]</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">17. If we
          inquire into what the most accurate philosophers declare themselves
          to mean by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">material substance</span></em>, we shall find
          them acknowledge they have no other meaning annexed to those sounds
          but the idea of Being in general, together with the relative notion
          of its supporting accidents. The general idea of Being appeareth to
          me the most abstract and incomprehensible of all other; and as for
          its supporting accidents, this, as we have just now observed,
          cannot be understood in the common sense of those words: it must
          therefore be taken in some other sense, but what that is they do
          not explain. So that when I consider the two parts or branches
          which make the signification of the words <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          substance</span></em>, I am convinced there is no distinct meaning
          annexed to them. But why should we trouble ourselves any farther,
          in discussing this material <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> or support of figure
          and motion and other sensible qualities? Does it not suppose they
          have an existence without the mind? And is not this a direct
          repugnancy, and altogether inconceivable?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">18. But, though
          it were possible that solid, figured, moveable substances may exist
          without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet
          how is it possible for us to know this? Either we must know it by
          Sense or by Reason<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href=

          for our senses, by them we <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          ideas, or those things that are immediately perceived by sense,
          call them what you will: but they do not inform us that things
          exist without the mind, or unperceived, like to those which are
          perceived. This the materialists themselves acknowledge.—It remains
          therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things,
          it must be by reason inferring their existence from what is
          immediately perceived by sense. But (<a id="noteref_557" name=

          not see) what reason can induce us to believe the existence of
          bodies without the mind, from what we perceive, since the very
          patrons of Matter themselves do not pretend there is any necessary
          connexion betwixt them and our ideas? I say it is granted on all
          hands (and what happens in dreams, frensies, and the like, puts it
          beyond dispute) that it is possible we might be affected with all
          the ideas we have now, though no bodies existed without resembling
          them<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href=

          Hence it is evident the supposition of external bodies<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          not necessary for the producing our ideas; since it is granted they
          are produced sometimes, and might possibly be produced always, in
          the same order we see them in at present, without their
          concurrence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">19. But, though
          we might possibly have all our sensations without them, yet perhaps
          it may be thought easier to conceive and explain the manner of
          their production, by supposing external bodies in their likeness
          rather than otherwise; and so it might be at least probable there
          are such things as bodies that excite their ideas in our minds. But
          neither can this be said. For, though we give the materialists
          their external bodies, they by their own confession are never the
          nearer knowing how our ideas are produced; since they own
          themselves unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon
          spirit, or how it is possible it should imprint any idea in the
          mind<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href=

          since that is acknowledged to remain equally inexplicable with or
          without this supposition. If therefore it were possible for bodies
          to exist without the mind, yet to hold they do so must needs be a
          very precarious opinion; since it is to suppose, without any reason
          at all, that God has created innumerable beings that are entirely
          useless, and serve to no manner of purpose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">20. In short, if
          there were external bodies<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563"

          is impossible we should ever come to know it; and if there were
          not, we might have the very same reasons to think there were that
          we have now. Suppose—what no one can deny possible—an intelligence,
          without the help of external bodies, to be affected with the same
          train of sensations or ideas that you are, imprinted in the same
          order and with like vividness in his mind. I ask whether that
          intelligence hath not all the reason to believe the existence of
          Corporeal Substances, represented by his ideas, and exciting them
          in his mind, that you can possibly have for believing the same
          thing? Of this there can be no question. Which one consideration
          were enough to make any reasonable person suspect the strength of
          whatever arguments he may think himself to have, for the existence
          of bodies without the mind.</p>

          you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees,

          therefore is nothing to the purpose: it only shews you have the
          power of imagining, or forming ideas in your mind; but it does not
          shew that you can conceive it possible the objects of your thought

          conceive bodies existing unthought of, or without the mind, though
          at the same time they are apprehended by, or exist in, itself. A

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">25. All our
          ideas, sensations, notions<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571"
          href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          the things which we perceive, by whatsoever names they may be
          distinguished, are visibly inactive: there is nothing of power or
          agency <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
          271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          included in them. So that one idea or object of thought cannot
          produce or make any alteration in another<a id="noteref_572" name=
          "noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a>. To
          be satisfied of the truth of this, there is nothing else requisite
          but a bare observation of our ideas. For, since they and every part
          of them exist only in the mind, it follows that there is nothing in
          them but what is perceived; but whoever shall attend to his ideas,
          whether of sense or reflexion, will not perceive in them any power
          or activity; there is, therefore, no such thing contained in them.
          A little attention will discover to us that the very being of an
          idea implies passiveness and inertness in it; insomuch that it is
          impossible for an idea to do anything, or, strictly speaking, to be
          the cause of anything: neither can it be the resemblance or pattern
          of any active being, as is evident from sect. 8. Whence it plainly
          follows that extension, figure, and motion cannot be the cause of
          our sensations. To say, therefore, that these are the effects of
          powers resulting from the configuration, number, motion, and size
          of corpuscles<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href=
          "#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a>, must
          certainly be false.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">26. We perceive
          a continual succession of ideas; some are anew excited, others are
          changed or totally disappear. There is therefore <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em>
          cause of these ideas, whereon they depend, and which produces and
          changes them<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href=

          this cause cannot be any quality or idea or combination of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>, is clear from the preceding
          section. It must therefore be a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substance</span></em>; but it has been shewn
          that there is no corporeal or material substance: it remains
          therefore that the cause of ideas is an incorporeal active
          substance or Spirit<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href=
          "#note_575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">27. A Spirit is
          one simple, undivided active being—as it perceives ideas it is
          called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          or otherwise operates about them it is called the <em class=

          Hence there can be no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          for all ideas whatever, being passive and inert (vid. sect. 25),
          they cannot represent unto us, by way of image or likeness, that
          which acts. A little attention will make it plain to any one, that
          to have an idea which shall be <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">like</span></em>
          that active Principle of motion and change of ideas is absolutely
          impossible. Such is the nature of Spirit, or that which acts, that
          it cannot be of itself perceived, but only by the effects which it
          produceth<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href=

          any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered, let him
          but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active
          being; and whether he has ideas of two principal powers, marked by
          the names <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          other, as well as from a third idea of Substance or Being in
          general, with a relative notion of its supporting or being the
          subject of the aforesaid powers—which is signified by the name
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          properly denominate the mind active. Thus much is certain and
          grounded on experience: but when we talk of unthinking agents, or
          of exciting ideas exclusive of volition, we only amuse ourselves

          whatever power I may have over my own thoughts, I find the ideas

          open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see
          or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present
          themselves to my view: and so likewise as to the hearing and other
          senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">30. The ideas of
          Sense are more strong, lively, and distinct than those of the

          "#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          have likewise a steadiness, order, and coherence, and are not
          excited at random, as those which are the effects of human wills
          often are, but in a regular train or series—the admirable connexion
          whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its
          Author. Now the set rules, or established methods, wherein the Mind
          we depend on excites in us the ideas of Sense, are called
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the laws
          of nature</span></em>; and these we learn by experience, which
          teaches us that such and such ideas are attended with such and such
          other ideas, in the ordinary course of things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">31. This gives
          us a sort of foresight, which enables us to regulate our actions
          for the benefit of life. And without this we should be eternally at

          how to act anything that might procure us the least pleasure, or
          remove the least pain of sense. That food nourishes, sleep
          refreshes, and fire warms us; that to sow in the seed-time is the
          way to reap in the harvest; and in general that to obtain such or
          such ends, such or such means are conducive—all this we know, not
          by discovering any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          ideas, but only by the observation of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">settled
          laws</span></em> of nature; without which we should be all in
          uncertainty and confusion, and a grown man no more know how to

          consistent uniform working, which so evidently displays the
          Goodness and Wisdom of that Governing Spirit whose Will constitutes
          the laws of nature, is so far from leading our thoughts to Him,
          that it rather sends them wandering after second causes<a id=

          when we perceive certain ideas of Sense constantly followed by
          other ideas, and we know this is not of our own doing, we forthwith
          attribute power and agency to the ideas themselves, and make one
          the cause of another, than which nothing can be more absurd and
          unintelligible. Thus, for example, having observed that when we
          perceive by sight a certain round luminous figure, we at the same
          time perceive by touch the idea or sensation called heat, we do
          from thence conclude the sun to be the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>
          of heat. And in like manner perceiving the motion and collision of
          bodies to be attended with sound, we are inclined to think the
          latter the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">33. The ideas
          imprinted on the Senses by the Author of nature are called

          then, it will be objected that by the foregoing principles all that
          is real and substantial in nature is banished out of the world, and
          instead thereof a chimerical scheme of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>
          takes place. All things that exist exist only in the mind; that is,
          they are purely notional. What therefore becomes of the sun, moon,
          and stars? What must we think of houses, rivers, mountains, trees,
          stones; nay, even of our own bodies? Are all these but so many
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name=
          "Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> chimeras and
          illusions on the fancy?—To all which, and whatever else of the same
          sort may be objected, I answer, that by the Principles premised we
          are not deprived of any one thing in nature. Whatever we see, feel,
          hear, or any wise conceive or understand, remains as secure as
          ever, and is as real as ever. There is a <span lang="la" class=

          "font-style: italic">rerum natura</span></span>, and the
          distinction between realities and chimeras retains its full force.
          This is evident from sect. 29, 30, and 33, where we have shewn what
          is meant by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          and in that sense<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href=

          argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend,

          respect of others they perceive by sense: which, being impressed
          upon them according to certain rules or laws of nature, speak
          themselves the effects of a Mind more powerful and wise than human

          answer is, that if the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substance</span></em> be taken in the vulgar
          sense, for a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          such as extension, solidity, weight, and the like—this we cannot be
          accused of taking away: but if it be taken in a philosophic sense,
          for the support of accidents or qualities without the mind—then
          indeed I acknowledge that we take it away, if one may be said to
          take away that which never had any existence, not even in the
          imagination<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">38. But after
          all, say you, it sounds very harsh to say we eat and drink ideas,
          and are clothed with ideas. I acknowledge it does so—the word
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em> not being used in common
          discourse to signify the several combinations of sensible qualities
          which are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">things</span></em>; and it is certain that any
          expression which varies from the familiar use of language will seem
          harsh and ridiculous. But this doth not concern the truth of the
          proposition, which in other words is no more than to say, we are
          fed and clothed with those things which we perceive immediately by
          our senses<a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href=

          exist only in the mind that perceives them: and this is all that is
          meant by calling them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>; which word, if it was as
          ordinarily used as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">thing</span></em>, would sound no harsher nor
          more ridiculous than it. I am not for disputing about the
          propriety, but the truth of the expression. If therefore you agree
          with me that we eat and drink and are clad with the immediate
          objects of sense, which cannot exist unperceived or without the
          mind, I shall readily grant it is more proper or conformable to
          custom that they should be called <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>
          rather than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">39. If it be
          demanded why I make use of the word <em class=

          and do not rather in compliance with custom call them <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>;
          I answer, I do it for two reasons:—First, because the term
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">thing</span></em>, in contradistinction to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, is generally supposed to
          denote somewhat existing without the mind: Secondly, because
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">thing</span></em> hath a more comprehensive
          signification than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          thinking things<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a>, as
          well as ideas. Since therefore the objects of sense exist only in
          the mind, and are withal thoughtless and inactive, I chose to mark
          them by the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em>; which implies those
          properties<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">40. But, say
          what we can, some one perhaps may be apt to reply, he will still
          believe his senses, and never suffer any arguments, how plausible
          soever, to prevail over the certainty of them. Be it so; assert the
          evidence of sense as high as you please, we are willing to do the
          same. That what I see, hear, and feel doth exist, that is to say,
          is perceived by me, I no more doubt than I do of my own being. But
          I do not see how the testimony of sense can be alleged as a proof
          for the existence of anything which is <em class=

          there is a great difference betwixt real fire for instance, and the
          idea of fire, betwixt dreaming or imagining oneself burnt, and
          actually being so. [<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href=

          suspect it to be only the idea of fire which you see, do but put
          your hand into it and you will be convinced with a witness.] This
          and the like may be urged in opposition to our tenets.—To all which

          I shall only add in this place, that if real fire be very different
          from the idea of fire, so also is the real pain that it occasions
          very different from the idea of the same pain, and yet nobody will
          pretend that real pain either is, or can possibly be, in an
          unperceiving thing, or without the mind, any more than its

          we see things actually without or at a distance from us, and which
          consequently do not exist in the mind; it being absurd that those
          things which are seen at the distance of several miles should be as

          answer to this, I desire it may be considered that in a dream we do
          oft perceive things as existing at a great distance off, and yet
          for all that, those things are acknowledged to have their existence
          only in the mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">43. But, for the
          fuller clearing of this point, it may be worth while to consider
          how it is that we perceive distance, and things placed at a
          distance, by sight. For, that we should in truth <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></em>
          external space, and bodies actually existing in it, some nearer,

          said of their existing nowhere without the mind. The consideration
          of this difficulty it was that gave birth to my <span class=

          that it is only suggested to our thoughts by certain visible ideas,

          by a connexion taught us by experience, they come to signify and

          not, at first sight, think the things he saw to be without his

          forementioned treatise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">44. The ideas of

          not suffer himself to be imposed on by words. If he can conceive it
          possible either for his ideas or their archetypes to exist without
          being perceived, then I give up the cause. But if he cannot, he
          will acknowledge it is unreasonable for him to stand up in defence
          of he knows not what, and pretend to charge on me as an absurdity,
          the not assenting to those propositions which at bottom have no
          meaning in them<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">46. It will not
          be amiss to observe how far the received principles of philosophy
          are themselves chargeable with those pretended absurdities. It is
          thought strangely absurd that upon closing my eyelids all the
          visible objects around me should be reduced to nothing; and yet is
          not this what philosophers commonly acknowledge, when they agree on
          all hands that light and colours, which alone are the proper and
          immediate objects of sight, are mere sensations that exist no
          longer than they are perceived? Again, it may to some perhaps seem
          very incredible that things should be every moment creating; yet
          this very notion is commonly taught in the schools. For the
          Schoolmen, though they acknowledge the existence of Matter<a id=
          "noteref_617" name="noteref_617" href="#note_617"><span class=

          that the whole mundane fabric is framed out of it, are nevertheless
          of opinion that it cannot subsist without the divine conservation;
          which by them is expounded to be a continual creation<a id=
          "noteref_618" name="noteref_618" href="#note_618"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">47. Farther, a
          little thought will discover to us that, though we allow the
          existence of Matter or corporeal substance, yet it will unavoidably
          follow, from the principles which are now generally admitted, that
          the particular bodies, of what kind soever, do none of them exist
          whilst they are not perceived. For, it is evident, from sect. 11
          and the following sections, that the Matter philosophers contend
          for is an incomprehensible Somewhat, which hath <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> none of those particular qualities
          whereby the bodies falling under our senses are distinguished one
          from another. But, to make this more plain, it must be remarked
          that the infinite divisibility of Matter is now universally
          allowed, at least by the most approved and considerable
          philosophers, who on the received principles demonstrate it beyond
          all exception. Hence, it follows there is an infinite number of
          parts in each particle of Matter which are not perceived by
          sense<a id="noteref_619" name="noteref_619" href=
          "#note_619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">619</span></span></a>. The
          reason therefore that any particular body seems to be of a finite
          magnitude, or exhibits only a finite number of parts to sense, is,
          not because it contains no more, since in itself it contains an
          infinite number of parts, but because the sense is not acute enough
          to discern them. In proportion therefore as the sense is rendered
          more acute, it perceives a greater number of parts in the object,
          that is, the object appears greater; and its figure varies, those
          parts in its extremities which were before unperceivable appearing
          now to bound it in very different lines and angles from those
          perceived by an obtuser sense. And at length, after various changes
          of size and shape, when the sense becomes infinitely acute, the
          body shall seem infinite. During all which there is no alteration
          in the body, but only in the sense. Each body therefore, considered
          in itself, is infinitely extended, and consequently void of all
          shape and figure. From which it follows that, though we should
          grant the existence of Matter to be never so certain, yet it is
          withal as certain, the materialists themselves are by their own
          principles forced to acknowledge, that neither the particular
          bodies perceived by sense, nor anything like them, exists without
          the mind. Matter, I say, and each particle thereof, is according to
          them infinite and shapeless; and it is the mind that frames all
          that variety of bodies which compose the visible world, any one
          whereof does not exist longer than it is perceived.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">48. But, after
          all, if we consider it, the objection proposed in sect. 45 will not
          be found reasonably charged on the Principles we have premised, so
          as in truth to make any objection at all against our notions. For,
          though we hold indeed the objects of sense to be nothing else but
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name=
          "Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ideas which cannot
          exist unperceived, yet we may not hence conclude they have no
          existence except only while they are perceived by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></em>;
          since there may be some other spirit that perceives them though we
          do not. Wherever bodies are said to have no existence without the
          mind, I would not be understood to mean this or that particular
          mind, but all minds whatsoever. It does not therefore follow from
          the foregoing Principles that bodies are annihilated and created
          every moment, or exist not at all during the intervals between
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Fifthly</span></em>, it may perhaps be
          objected that if extension and figure exist only in the mind, it
          follows that the mind is extended and figured; since extension is a
          mode or attribute which (to speak with the Schools) is predicated
          of the subject in which it exists.—I answer, those qualities are in
          the mind only as they are perceived by it;—that is, not by way of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mode</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a>. And
          it no more follows the soul or mind is extended, because extension
          exists in it alone, than it does that it is red or blue, because
          those colours are on all hands acknowledged to exist in it, and
          nowhere else. As to what philosophers say of subject and mode, that
          seems very groundless and unintelligible. For instance, in this
          proposition <span class="tei tei-q">“a die is hard, extended, and
          square,”</span> they will have it that the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">die</span></em>
          denotes a subject or substance, distinct from the hardness,
          extension, and figure which are predicated of it, and in which they
          exist. This I cannot comprehend: to me a die seems to be nothing
          distinct from those things which are termed its modes or accidents.
          And, to say a die is hard, extended, and <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class=

          a subject distinct from and supporting them, but only an
          explication of the meaning of the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          been a great many things explained by matter and motion; take away
          these and you destroy the whole corpuscular philosophy, and
          undermine those mechanical principles which have been applied with
          so much success to account for the phenomena. In short, whatever
          advances have been made, either by ancient or modern philosophers,
          in the study of nature do all proceed on the supposition that
          corporeal substance or Matter doth really exist.—To this I answer
          that there is not any one phenomenon explained on that supposition
          which may not as well be explained without it, as might easily be
          made appear by an induction of particulars. To explain the
          phenomena, is all one as to shew why, upon such and such occasions,
          we are affected with such and such ideas. But how Matter should
          operate on a Spirit, or produce any idea in it, is what no
          philosopher will pretend to explain; it is therefore evident there
          can be no use of Matter<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href=

          natural philosophy. Besides, they who attempt to account for things
          do it, not by corporeal substance, but by figure, motion, and other
          qualities; which are in truth no more than mere ideas, and
          therefore cannot be the cause of anything, as hath been already
          shewn. See sect. 25.</p>

          ascribe everything to the immediate operation of spirits? We must
          no longer say upon these principles that fire heats, or water
          cools, but that a spirit heats, and so forth. Would not a man be
          deservedly laughed at, who should talk after this manner?—I answer,
          he would so: in such things we ought to think with the learned and
          speak with the vulgar. They who to demonstration are convinced of

          they affected a contrary style in common talk it would without
          doubt appear very ridiculous. A little reflection on what is here

          receive no manner of alteration or disturbance from the admission

          may be if taken in a strict and speculative sense. Nay, this is
          unavoidable, since, propriety being regulated by custom, language
          is suited to the received opinions, which are not always the
          truest. Hence it is impossible—even in the most rigid, philosophic
          reasonings—so far to alter the bent and genius of the tongue we
          speak as never to give a handle for cavillers to pretend
          difficulties and inconsistencies. But, a fair and ingenuous reader

          opinion that there are no corporeal causes, this has been
          heretofore maintained by some of the Schoolmen, as it is of late by
          others among the modern philosophers; who though they allow Matter
          to exist, yet will have God alone to be the immediate efficient
          cause of all things<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href=

          These men saw that amongst all the objects of sense there was none
          which had any power or activity included in it; and that by
          consequence this was likewise true of whatever bodies <span class=

          impossible; and whether the foregoing expressions are not of that
          sort, I refer it to the impartial examination of the reader. In one
          sense, indeed, men may be said to believe that Matter exists; that
          is, they act as if the immediate cause of their sensations, which
          affects them every moment, and is so nearly present to them, were
          some senseless unthinking being. But, that they should clearly
          apprehend any meaning marked by those words, and form thereof a
          settled speculative opinion, is what I am not able to conceive.
          This is not the only instance wherein men impose upon themselves,
          by imagining they believe those propositions which they have often
          heard, though at bottom they have no meaning in

          prejudices and false opinions are everywhere embraced with the
          utmost tenaciousness, by the unreflecting (which are the far
          greater) part of mankind. There was a time when the antipodes and

          ideas or objects of perception, had an existence independent of and

          at the same time run into another, which seems no less absurd, to
          wit, that there are certain objects really existing without the

          which our ideas are only images or resemblances, imprinted by those

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they evidently knew were imprinted from
          without, and which therefore must have <em class=

          cause, distinct from the minds on which they are imprinted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">57. But why they
          should suppose the ideas of sense to be excited in us by things in
          their likeness, and not rather have recourse to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirit</span></em>,
          which alone can act, may be accounted for. First, because they were
          not aware of the repugnancy there is, as well in supposing things
          like unto our ideas existing without, as in attributing to them
          power or activity. Secondly, because the Supreme Spirit which
          excites those ideas in our minds, is not marked out and limited to
          our view by any particular finite collection of sensible ideas, as
          human agents are by their size, complexion, limbs, and motions. And
          thirdly, because His operations are regular and uniform. Whenever
          the course of nature is interrupted by a miracle, men are ready to
          own the presence of a Superior Agent. But, when we see things go on
          in the ordinary course, they do not excite in us any reflexion;
          their order and concatenation, though it be an argument of the
          greatest wisdom, power, and goodness in their Creator, is yet so
          constant and familiar to us, that we do not think them the
          immediate effects of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Free Spirit</span></em>; especially since
          inconsistency and mutability in acting, though it be an
          imperfection, is looked on as a mark of <em class=

          the notions we advance are inconsistent with several sound truths
          in philosophy and mathematics. For example, the motion of the earth
          is now universally admitted by astronomers as a truth grounded on
          the clearest and most convincing reasons. But, on the foregoing
          Principles, there can be no such thing. For, motion being only an
          idea, it follows that if it be not perceived it exists not: but the
          motion of the earth is not perceived by sense.—I answer, That
          tenet, if rightly understood, will be found to agree with the
          Principles we have premised: for, the question <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whether the earth moves or no amounts
          in reality to no more than this, to wit, whether we have reason to
          conclude, from what has been observed by astronomers, that if we
          were placed in such and such circumstances, and such or such a
          position and distance both from the earth and sun, we should
          perceive the former to move among the choir of the planets, and
          appearing in all respects like one of them: and this, by the
          established rules of nature, which we have no reason to mistrust,
          is reasonably collected from the phenomena.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">59. We may, from

          preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what hath

          demanded to what purpose serves that curious organization of
          plants, and the animal mechanism in the parts of animals. Might not
          vegetables grow, and shoot forth leaves and blossoms, and animals
          perform all their motions, as well without as with all that variety
          of internal parts so elegantly contrived and put together;—which,

          man or nature, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg
          291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to be made in vain. By this doctrine, though an artist hath made
          the spring and wheels, and every movement of a watch, and adjusted
          them in such a manner as he knew would produce the motions he
          designed; yet he must think all this done to no purpose, and that
          it is an Intelligence which directs the index, and points to the
          hour of the day. If so, why may not the Intelligence do it, without
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">his</span></em> being at the pains of making
          the movements and putting them together? Why does not an empty case
          serve as well as another? And how comes it to pass, that whenever
          there is any fault in the going of a watch, there is some
          corresponding disorder to be found in the movements, which being
          mended by a skilful hand all is right again? The like may be said
          of all the Clockwork of Nature, great part whereof is so
          wonderfully fine and subtle as scarce to be discerned by the best
          microscope. In short, it will be asked, how, upon our Principles,
          any tolerable account can be given, or any final cause assigned of
          an innumerable multitude of bodies and machines, framed with the
          most exquisite art, which in the common philosophy have very
          apposite uses assigned them, and serve to explain abundance of
          phenomena?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">61. To all which
          I answer, first, that though there were some difficulties relating
          to the administration of Providence, and the uses by it assigned to
          the several parts of nature, which I could not solve by the
          foregoing Principles, yet this objection could be of small weight
          against the truth and certainty of those things which may be proved
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a priori</span></span>, with the utmost
          evidence and rigour of demonstration<a id="noteref_635" name=

          Secondly, but neither are the received principles free from the
          like difficulties; for, it may still be demanded to what end God
          should take those roundabout methods of effecting things by
          instruments and machines, which no one can deny might have been
          effected by the mere command of His will, without all that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">apparatus</span></em>. Nay, if we narrowly
          consider it, we shall find the objection may be retorted with
          greater force on those who hold the existence of those machines
          without the mind; for it has been made evident that solidity, bulk,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name=
          "Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> figure, motion, and
          the like have no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">activity</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">efficacy</span></em> in them, so as to be
          capable of producing any one effect in nature. See sect. 25.
          Whoever therefore supposes them to exist (allowing the supposition
          possible) when they are not perceived does it manifestly to no
          purpose; since the only use that is assigned to them, as they exist
          unperceived, is that they produce those perceivable effects which
          in truth cannot be ascribed to anything but Spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">62. But, to come
          nigher the difficulty, it must be observed that though the
          fabrication of all those parts and organs be not absolutely
          necessary to the producing any effect, yet it is necessary to the
          producing of things in a constant regular way, according to the
          laws of nature. There are certain general laws that run through the
          whole chain of natural effects: these are learned by the
          observation and study of nature, and are by men applied, as well to
          the framing artificial things for the use and ornament of life as
          to the explaining the various phenomena. Which explication consists
          only in shewing the conformity any particular phenomenon hath to
          the general laws of nature, or, which is the same thing, in
          discovering the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">uniformity</span></em> there is in the
          production of natural effects; as will be evident to whoever shall
          attend to the several instances wherein philosophers pretend to
          account for appearances. That there is a great and conspicuous
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">use</span></em> in these regular constant
          methods of working observed by the Supreme Agent hath been shewn in
          sect. 31. And it is no less visible that a particular size, figure,
          motion, and disposition of parts are necessary, though not
          absolutely to the producing any effect, yet to the producing it
          according to the standing mechanical laws of nature. Thus, for
          instance, it cannot be denied that God, or the Intelligence that
          sustains and rules the ordinary course of things, might if He were
          minded to produce a miracle, cause all the motions on the
          dial-plate of a watch, though nobody had ever made the movements
          and put them in it. But yet, if He will act agreeably to the rules
          of mechanism, by Him for wise ends established and maintained in
          the creation, it is necessary that those actions of the watchmaker,
          whereby <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">he</span></em> makes the movements and rightly
          adjusts them, precede the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
          293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          production of the aforesaid motions; as also that any disorder in
          them be attended with the perception of some corresponding disorder
          in the movements, which being once corrected all is right
          again<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href=
          "#note_636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">63. It may
          indeed on some occasions be necessary that the Author of nature
          display His overruling power in producing some appearance out of
          the ordinary series of things. Such exceptions from the general
          rules of nature are proper to surprise and awe men into an
          acknowledgment of the Divine Being; but then they are to be used
          but seldom, otherwise there is a plain reason why they should fail
          of that effect. Besides, God seems to choose the convincing our
          reason of His attributes by the works of nature, which discover so
          much harmony and contrivance in their make, and are such plain
          indications of wisdom and beneficence in their Author, rather than
          to astonish us into a belief of His Being by anomalous and
          surprising events<a id="noteref_637" name="noteref_637" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">64. To set this
          matter in a yet clearer light, I shall observe that what has been
          objected in sect. 60 amounts in reality to no more than
          this:—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em><a id="noteref_638" name=
          "noteref_638" href="#note_638"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a> are
          not anyhow and at random produced, there being a certain order and
          connexion between them, like to that of cause and effect: there are
          also several combinations of them, made in a very regular and
          artificial manner, which seem like so many instruments in the hand
          of nature that, being hid as it were behind the scenes, have a
          secret operation in producing those appearances which are seen on
          the theatre of the world, being themselves discernible only to the
          curious eye of the philosopher. But, since one idea cannot be the
          cause of another, to what purpose is that connexion? And since
          those instruments, being barely <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inefficacious</span></em> perceptions in the
          mind, are not subservient <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg
          294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to the production of natural effects, it is demanded why they are
          made; or, in other words, what reason can be assigned why God
          should make us, upon a close inspection into His works, behold so
          great variety of ideas, so artfully laid together, and so much
          according to rule; it not being [<a id="noteref_639" name=

          credible] that He would be at the expense (if one may so speak) of
          all that art and regularity to no purpose?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">65. To all which
          my answer is, first, that the connexion of ideas<a id="noteref_640"
          name="noteref_640" href="#note_640"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a> does
          not imply the relation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cause</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effect</span></em>,
          but only of a mark or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sign</span></em> with the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing
          signified</span></em>. The fire which I see is not the cause of the
          pain I suffer upon my approaching it, but the mark that forewarns
          me of it. In like manner the noise that I hear is not the effect of
          this or that motion or collision of the ambient bodies, but the
          sign thereof<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href=
          "#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a>.
          Secondly, the reason why ideas are formed into machines, that is,
          artificial and regular combinations, is the same with that for
          combining letters into words. That a few original ideas may be made
          to signify a great number of effects and actions, it is necessary
          they be variously combined together. And to the end their use be
          permanent and universal, these combinations must be made by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rule</span></em>, and with <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wise
          contrivance</span></em>. By this means abundance of information is
          conveyed unto us, concerning what we are to expect from such and
          such actions, and what methods are proper to be taken for the
          exciting such and such ideas<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642"
          href="#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a>.
          Which in effect is all that I conceive to be distinctly meant when
          it is said<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href=
          "#note_643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> that,
          by discerning the figure, texture, and mechanism of the inward
          parts of bodies, whether natural or artificial, we may attain to
          know the several uses <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg
          295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and properties depending thereon, or the nature of the thing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">66. Hence, it is
          evident that those things which, under the notion of a cause
          co-operating or concurring to the production of effects, are
          altogether inexplicable and run us into great absurdities, may be
          very naturally explained, and have a proper and obvious use
          assigned to them, when they are considered only as marks or signs
          for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          searching after and endeavouring to understand this Language (if I
          may so call it) of the Author of Nature, that ought to be the
          employment of the natural philosopher; and not the pretending to
          explain things by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          seems to have too much estranged the minds of men from that Active

          philosophers describe Matter; yet, if any man shall leave out of
          his idea of Matter the positive ideas of extension, figure,
          solidity and motion, and say that he means only by that word an
          inert, senseless substance, that exists without the mind, or
          unperceived, which is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em> of our ideas, or at the
          presence whereof God is pleased to excite ideas in us—it doth not
          appear but that Matter taken in this sense may possibly exist.—In
          answer to which I say, first, that it seems no less absurd to
          suppose a substance without accidents, than it is to suppose
          accidents without a substance<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644"
          href="#note_644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a>. But
          secondly, though we should grant this unknown substance may
          possibly exist, yet where can it be supposed to be? That it exists
          not in the mind<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href=
          "#note_645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">645</span></span></a> is
          agreed; and that it exists not in place is no less certain, since
          all place or extension <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg
          296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          exists only in the mind<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href=
          "#note_646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">646</span></span></a>, as
          hath been already proved. It remains therefore that it exists
          nowhere at all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">68. Let us
          examine a little the description that is here given us of Matter.
          It neither acts, nor perceives, nor is perceived: for this is all
          that is meant by saying it is an inert, senseless, unknown
          substance; which is a definition entirely made up of negatives,
          excepting only the relative notion of its standing under or
          supporting. But then it must be observed that it supports nothing
          at all, and how nearly this comes to the description of a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nonentity</span></em> I desire may be
          considered. But, say you, it is the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unknown
          occasion</span></em><a id="noteref_647" name="noteref_647" href=
          "#note_647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a>, at
          the presence of which ideas are excited in us by the will of God.
          Now, I would fain know how anything can be present to us, which is
          neither perceivable by sense nor reflexion, nor capable of
          producing any idea in our minds, nor is at all extended, nor hath
          any form, nor exists in any place. The words <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to be present,”</span> when thus applied, must needs
          be taken in some abstract and strange meaning, and which I am not
          able to comprehend.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">69. Again, let
          us examine what is meant by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em>. So far as I can gather
          from the common use of language, that word signifies either the
          agent which produces any effect, or else something that is observed
          to accompany or go before it, in the ordinary course of things.
          But, when it is applied to Matter, as above described, it can be
          taken in neither of those senses; for Matter is said to be passive
          and inert, and so cannot be an agent or efficient cause. It is also
          unperceivable, as being devoid of all sensible qualities, and so
          cannot be the occasion of our perceptions in the latter sense; as
          when the burning my finger is said to be the occasion of the pain
          that attends it. What therefore can be meant by calling <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">matter</span></em>
          an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em>? This term is either used
          in no sense at all, or else in some very distant from its received
          signification.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">70. You will
          perhaps say that Matter, though it be not perceived by us, is
          nevertheless perceived by God, to whom it is the occasion of
          exciting ideas in our minds<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648"
          href="#note_648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">648</span></span></a>.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name=
          "Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> For, say you, since
          we observe our sensations to be imprinted in an orderly and
          constant manner, it is but reasonable to suppose there are certain
          constant and regular occasions of their being produced. That is to
          say, that there are certain permanent and distinct parcels of
          Matter, corresponding to our ideas, which, though they do not
          excite them in our minds, or anywise immediately affect us, as
          being altogether passive, and unperceivable to us, they are
          nevertheless to God, by whom they <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em>
          perceived<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href=
          "#note_649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a>, as
          it were so many occasions to remind Him when and what ideas to
          imprint on our minds: that so things may go on in a constant
          uniform manner.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">71. In answer to
          this, I observe that, as the notion of Matter is here stated, the
          question is no longer concerning the existence of a thing distinct
          from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Spirit</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
          from perceiving and being perceived; but whether there are not
          certain Ideas (of I know not what sort) in the mind of God, which
          are so many marks or notes that direct Him how to produce
          sensations in our minds in a constant and regular method: much
          after the same manner as a musician is directed by the notes of
          music to produce that harmonious train and composition of sound
          which is called a tune; though they who hear the music do not
          perceive the notes, and may be entirely ignorant of them. But this
          notion of Matter (which after all is the only intelligible one that
          I can pick from what is said of unknown occasions) seems too
          extravagant to deserve a confutation. Besides, it is in effect no
          objection against what we have advanced, viz. that there is no
          senseless unperceived substance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">72. If we follow
          the light of reason, we shall, from the constant uniform method of
          our sensations, collect the goodness and wisdom of the Spirit who
          excites them in our minds; but this is all that I can see
          reasonably concluded from thence. To me, I say, it is evident that
          the being of a Spirit—infinitely wise, good, and powerful—is
          abundantly sufficient to explain all the appearances of
          nature<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href=
          "#note_650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a>. But,
          as for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inert, senseless Matter</span></em>, nothing
          that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name=
          "Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> I perceive has any
          the least connexion with it, or leads to the thoughts of it. And I
          would fain see any one explain any the meanest phenomenon in nature
          by it, or shew any manner of reason, though in the lowest rank of
          probability, that he can have for its existence; or even make any
          tolerable sense or meaning of that supposition. For, as to its
          being an occasion, we have, I think, evidently shewn that with
          regard to us it is no occasion. It remains therefore that it must
          be, if at all, the occasion to God of exciting ideas in us; and
          what this amounts to we have just now seen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">73. It is worth
          while to reflect a little on the motives which induced men to
          suppose the existence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">material substance</span></em>; that so having
          observed the gradual ceasing and expiration of those motives or
          reasons, we may proportionably withdraw the assent that was
          grounded on them. First, therefore, it was thought that colour,
          figure, motion, and the rest of the sensible qualities or
          accidents, did really exist without the mind; and for this reason
          it seemed needful to suppose some unthinking <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> or substance wherein
          they did exist, since they could not be conceived to exist by
          themselves<a id="noteref_651" name="noteref_651" href=
          "#note_651"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">651</span></span></a>.
          Afterwards, in process of time, men<a id="noteref_652" name=
          "noteref_652" href="#note_652"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a> being
          convinced that colours, sounds, and the rest of the sensible,
          secondary qualities had no existence without the mind, they
          stripped this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> or material substance
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">those</span></em> qualities, leaving only the
          primary ones, figure, motion, and suchlike; which they still
          conceived to exist without the mind, and consequently to stand in
          need of a material support. But, it having been shewn that none
          even of these can possibly exist otherwise than in a Spirit or Mind
          which perceives them, it follows that we have no longer any reason
          to suppose the being of Matter<a id="noteref_653" name=
          "noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a>, nay,
          that it is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg
          299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          utterly impossible there should be any such thing;—so long as that
          word is taken to denote an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unthinking substratum</span></em> of qualities
          or accidents, wherein they exist without the mind<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">74. But—though
          it be allowed by the materialists themselves that Matter was
          thought of only for the sake of supporting accidents, and, the
          reason entirely ceasing, one might expect the mind should
          naturally, and without any reluctance at all, quit the belief of
          what was solely grounded thereon: yet the prejudice is riveted so
          deeply in our thoughts that we can scarce tell how to part with it,
          and are therefore inclined, since the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing</span></em>
          itself is indefensible, at least to retain the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">name</span></em>;
          which we apply to I know not what abstracted and indefinite notions
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">being</span></em>, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em>, though without any shew
          of reason, at least so far as I can see. For, what is there on our
          part, or what do we perceive, amongst all the ideas, sensations,
          notions which are imprinted on our minds, either by sense or
          reflexion, from whence may be inferred the existence of an inert,
          thoughtless, unperceived occasion? and, on the other hand, on the
          part of an All-sufficient Spirit, what can there be that should
          make us believe or even suspect He is directed by an inert occasion
          to excite ideas in our minds?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">75. It is a very
          extraordinary instance of the force of prejudice, and much to be
          lamented, that the mind of man retains so great a fondness, against
          all the evidence of reason, for a stupid thoughtless <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Somewhat</span></em>, by the interposition
          whereof it would as it were screen itself from the Providence of
          God, and remove it farther off from the affairs of the world. But,
          though we do the utmost we can to secure the belief of Matter;
          though, when reason forsakes us, we endeavour to support our
          opinion on the bare possibility of the thing, and though we indulge
          ourselves in the full scope of an imagination not regulated by
          reason to make out that poor possibility; yet the upshot of all
          is—that there are certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unknown</span></em> Ideas in the mind of God;
          for this, if anything, is all that I conceive to be meant by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em> with regard to God. And
          this at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">76. Whether
          therefore there are such Ideas in the mind of God, and whether
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          if you stick to the notion of an unthinking substance or support of
          extension, motion, and other sensible qualities, then to me it is
          most evidently impossible there should be any such thing; since it
          is a plain repugnancy that those qualities should exist in, or be
          supported by, an unperceiving substance<a id="noteref_657" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">77. But, say
          you, though it be granted that there is no thoughtless support of
          extension, and the other qualities or accidents which we perceive,
          yet there may perhaps be some inert, unperceiving substance or
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> of some other
          qualities, as incomprehensible to us as colours are to a man born
          blind, because we have not a sense adapted to them. But, if we had
          a new sense, we should possibly no more doubt of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em>
          existence than a blind man made to see does of the existence of
          light and colours.—I answer, first, if what you mean by the word
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> be only the unknown support
          of unknown qualities, it is no matter whether there is such a thing
          or no, since it no way concerns us. And I do not see the advantage
          there is in disputing about what we know not <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em>,
          and we know not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">78. But,
          secondly, if we had a new sense, it could only furnish us with new
          ideas or sensations; and then we should have the same reason
          against <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          danger of running into a contradiction. You may say, for example,

          so long as you declare you do not take the words of that
          proposition in their usual acceptation, but for marks of you know
          not what. And, by the same reason, you may say there is an inert
          thoughtless substance without accidents, which is the occasion of
          our ideas. And we shall understand just as much by one proposition
          as the other.</p>

          reply, perhaps, that in the foresaid definition is included what
          doth sufficiently distinguish it from nothing—the positive abstract

          those who pretend to the faculty of framing abstract general ideas
          do talk as if they had such an idea, which is, say they, the most
          abstract and general notion of all: that is to me the most
          incomprehensible of all others. That there are a great variety of
          spirits of different orders and capacities, whose faculties, both
          in number and extent, are far exceeding those the Author of my
          being has bestowed on me, I see no reason to deny. And for me to
          pretend to determine, by my own few, stinted, narrow inlets of
          perception, what ideas the inexhaustible power of the Supreme
          Spirit may imprint upon them, were certainly the utmost folly and
          presumption. Since there may be, for aught that I know, innumerable
          sorts of ideas or sensations, as different from one another, and
          from all that I have perceived, as colours are from sounds<a id=

          how ready soever I may be to acknowledge the scantiness of my

          exist, and are something more than mere ideas; there being in Holy

          having their truth called in question by our doctrine. That all
          those things do really exist; that there are bodies, even corporeal
          substances, when taken in the vulgar sense, has been shewn to be
          agreeable to our principles: and the difference betwixt <em class=

          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          explained. See sect. 29, 30, 33, 36, &amp;c. And I do not think
          that either what philosophers call <em class=

          or the existence of objects without the mind<a id="noteref_661"

          is agreed on all hands that the proper use of words is the marking
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">our</span></em> conceptions, or things only as
          they are known and perceived by us: whence it plainly follows, that
          in the tenets we have laid down there is nothing inconsistent with
          the right use and significancy of language, and that discourse, of
          what kind soever, so far as it is intelligible, remains
          undisturbed. But all this seems so very manifest, from what has
          been largely set forth in the premises, that it is needless to
          insist any farther on it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">84. But, it will
          be urged that miracles do, at least, lose much of their stress and
          import by our principles. What must we think of Moses' rod? was it
          not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">really</span></em> turned into a serpent? or
          was there only a change of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em> in the minds of the
          spectators? And, can it be supposed that our Saviour did no more at
          the marriage-feast in Cana than impose on the sight, and smell, and
          taste of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
          304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the guests, so as to create in them the appearance or idea only of
          wine? The same may be said of all other miracles: which, in
          consequence of the foregoing principles, must be looked upon only
          as so many cheats, or illusions of fancy.—To this I reply, that the
          rod was changed into a real serpent, and the water into real wine.
          That this does not in the least contradict what I have elsewhere
          said will be evident from sect. 34 and 35. But this business of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">real</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          plainly and fully explained, and so often referred to, and the
          difficulties about it are so easily answered from what has gone
          before, that it were an affront to the reader's understanding to
          resume the explication of it in this place. I shall only observe
          that if at table all who were present should see, and smell, and
          taste, and drink wine, and find the effects of it, with me there
          could be no doubt of its reality<a id="noteref_663" name=

          that at bottom the scruple concerning real miracles has no place at
          all on ours, but only on the received principles, and consequently
          makes rather for than against what has been said.</p>

          of these appear at first sight—as that several difficult and
          obscure questions, on which abundance of speculation has been
          thrown away, are entirely banished from philosophy. Whether
          corporeal substance can think? Whether Matter be infinitely

          absolutely, or in itself, it is impossible for us to know, but only
          the proportion or relation they bear to our senses. Things

          whether any of them at all, represent the true quality really
          existing in the thing, it is out of our reach to determine. So
          that, for aught we know, all we see, hear, and feel, may be only

          we attribute a real existence to unthinking things, distinct from
          their being perceived, it is not only impossible for us to know
          with evidence the nature of any real unthinking being, but even
          that it exists. Hence it is that we see philosophers distrust their
          senses, and doubt of the existence of heaven and earth, of
          everything they see or feel, even of their own bodies. And after
          all their labouring and struggle of thought, they are forced to own
          we cannot attain to any self-evident or demonstrative knowledge of

          since the very being of a sensation or idea consists in being
          perceived, and an idea can be like nothing but an idea. Again, the

          origin; in that they are not generated from within by the mind

          <span class="tei tei-q">“without the mind”</span> in another sense,
          namely when they exist in some other mind. Thus, when I shut my

          mistake to think that what is here said derogates in the least from
          the reality of things. It is acknowledged, on the received
          principles, that extension, motion, and in a word all sensible
          qualities, have need of a support, as not being able to subsist by
          themselves. But the objects perceived by sense are allowed to be
          nothing but combinations of those qualities, and consequently
          cannot subsist by themselves<a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680"

          far it is agreed on all hands. So that in denying the things
          perceived by sense an existence independent of a substance or
          support wherein they may exist, we detract nothing from the
          received opinion of their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          innovation in that respect. All the difference is that, according
          to us, the unthinking beings perceived by sense have no existence
          distinct from being perceived, and cannot therefore exist in any
          other substance than those unextended indivisible substances, or

          attributing the whole series of events either to blind chance or

          Epicureans, Hobbists, and the like, have not even the shadow of a

          main support of Atheists and Fatalists, but on the same principle
          doth Idolatry likewise in all its various forms depend. Did men but
          consider that the sun, moon, and stars, and every other object of
          the senses, are only so many sensations in their minds, which have
          no other existence but barely being perceived, doubtless they would
          never fall down and worship <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          been set forth in the Introduction. The plainest things in the
          world, those we are most intimately acquainted with and perfectly
          know, when they are considered in an abstract way, appear strangely
          difficult and incomprehensible. Time, place, and motion, taken in
          particular or concrete, are what everybody knows; but, having
          passed through the hands of a metaphysician, they become too
          abstract and fine to be apprehended by men of ordinary sense. Bid
          your servant meet you at such a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>,
          in such a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">place</span></em>, and he shall never stay to
          deliberate on the meaning of those words. In conceiving that
          particular time and place, or the motion by which he is to get
          thither, he finds not the least difficulty. But if <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em> be
          taken exclusive of all those particular actions and ideas that
          diversify the day, merely for the continuation of existence or
          duration in abstract, then it will perhaps gravel even a
          philosopher to comprehend it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">98. For my own
          part, whenever I attempt to frame a simple idea of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>,
          abstracted from the succession of ideas in my mind, which flows
          uniformly, and is participated by all beings, I am lost and
          embrangled in inextricable difficulties. I have no notion of it at
          all: only I hear others say it is infinitely divisible, and speak
          of it in such a manner as leads me to harbour odd thoughts of my
          existence: since that doctrine lays one under an absolute necessity
          of thinking, either that he passes away innumerable ages without a
          thought, or else that he is annihilated every moment of his life:
          both <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name=
          "Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which seem equally

          therefore being nothing, abstracted from the succession of ideas in
          our minds, it follows that the duration of any finite spirit must
          be estimated by the number of ideas or actions succeeding each
          other in that same spirit or mind. Hence, it is a plain consequence
          that the soul always thinks. And in truth whoever shall go about to
          divide in his thoughts or abstract the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">existence</span></em> of a spirit from its
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          first, it is supposed that extension, for example, may be
          abstracted from all other sensible qualities; and, secondly, that
          the entity of extension may be abstracted from its being perceived.

          for a man to be happy, or an object good, every one may think he
          knows. But to frame an abstract idea of happiness, prescinded from
          all particular pleasure, or of goodness from everything that is
          good, this is what few can pretend to. So likewise a man may be
          just and virtuous without having precise ideas of justice and
          virtue. The opinion that those and the like words stand for general
          notions, abstracted from all particular persons and actions, seems
          to have rendered morality difficult, and the study thereof of less

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And first I
          shall say somewhat of Natural Philosophy. On this subject it is
          that the sceptics triumph. All that stock of arguments they produce
          to depreciate our faculties and make mankind appear ignorant and
          low, are drawn principally from this head, namely, that we are
          under an invincible blindness as to the <em class=

          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">real</span></em> nature of things. This they
          exaggerate, and love to enlarge on. We are miserably bantered, say
          they, by our senses, and amused only with the outside and shew of
          things. The real <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg
          314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          essence, the internal qualities and constitution of every the
          meanest object, is hid from our view: something there is in every
          drop of water, every grain of sand, which it is beyond the power of
          human understanding to fathom or comprehend<a id="noteref_695"

          it is evident from what has been shewn that all this complaint is
          groundless, and that we are influenced by false principles to that
          degree as to mistrust our senses, and think we know nothing of
          those things which we perfectly comprehend.</p>

          inducement to our pronouncing ourselves ignorant of the nature of
          things is, the current opinion that every thing includes <em class=

          itself</span></em> the cause of its properties: or that there is in
          each object an inward essence, which is the source whence its
          discernible qualities flow, and whereon they depend. Some have
          pretended to account for appearances by occult qualities; but of
          late they are mostly resolved into mechanical causes, to wit, the
          figure, motion, weight, and suchlike qualities, of insensible
          particles<a id="noteref_696" name="noteref_696" href=

          whereas, in truth, there is no other agent or efficient cause than
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          motion, as well as all other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>, is perfectly inert. See
          sect. 25. Hence, to endeavour to explain the production of colours
          or sounds, by figure, motion, magnitude, and the like, must needs
          be labour in vain. And accordingly we see the attempts of that kind
          are not at all satisfactory. Which may be said in general of those
          instances wherein one idea or quality is assigned for the cause of
          another. I need not say how many hypotheses and speculations are
          left out, and how much the study of nature is abridged by this
          doctrine<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">103. The great
          mechanical principle now in vogue is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">attraction</span></em>. That a stone falls to
          the earth, or the sea swells towards the moon, may to some appear
          sufficiently explained thereby. But how are we enlightened by being
          told this is done by attraction? Is it that that word signifies the
          manner of the tendency, and that it is by the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mutual drawing of bodies instead of
          their being impelled or protruded towards each other? But nothing
          is determined of the manner or action, and it may as truly (for
          aught we know) be termed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">impulse</span></em>, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">attraction</span></em>. Again, the parts of
          steel we see cohere firmly together, and this also is accounted for
          by attraction; but, in this, as in the other instances, I do not
          perceive that anything is signified besides the effect itself; for
          as to the manner of the action whereby it is produced, or the cause
          which produces it, these are not so much as aimed at.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">104. Indeed, if
          we take a view of the several phenomena, and compare them together,
          we may observe some likeness and conformity between them. For
          example, in the falling of a stone to the ground, in the rising of
          the sea towards the moon, in cohesion and crystallization, there is
          something alike; namely, an union or mutual approach of bodies. So
          that any one of these or the like phenomena may not seem strange or
          surprising to a man who has nicely observed and compared the
          effects of nature. For that only is thought so which is uncommon,
          or a thing by itself, and out of the ordinary course of our
          observation. That bodies should tend towards the centre of the
          earth is not thought strange, because it is what we perceive every
          moment of our lives. But that they should have a like gravitation
          towards the centre of the moon may seem odd and unaccountable to
          most men, because it is discerned only in the tides. But a
          philosopher, whose thoughts take in a larger compass of nature,
          having observed a certain similitude of appearances, as well in the
          heavens as the earth, that argue innumerable bodies to have a
          mutual tendency towards each other, which he denotes by the general
          name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">attraction</span></em>, whatever can be
          reduced to that, he thinks justly accounted for. Thus he explains
          the tides by the attraction of the terraqueous globe towards the
          moon; which to him doth not appear odd or anomalous, but only a
          particular example of a general rule or law of nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">105. If
          therefore we consider the difference there is betwixt natural
          philosophers and other men, with regard to their knowledge of the
          phenomena, we shall find it consists, not in an exacter knowledge
          of the efficient cause that produces them—for that can be no other
          than the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          spirit</span></em>—but only in a greater largeness of
          comprehension, whereby analogies, harmonies, and agreements are
          discovered in the works of nature, and the particular effects
          explained, that is, reduced to general rules, see sect. 62: which
          rules, grounded on the analogy and uniformness observed in the
          production of natural effects, are most agreeable and sought after
          by the mind; for that they extend our prospect beyond what is
          present and near to us, and enable us to make very probable
          conjectures touching things that may have happened at very great
          distances of time and place, as well as to predict things to come:
          which sort of endeavour towards Omniscience is much affected by the
          mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">106. But we
          should proceed warily in such things: for we are apt to lay too
          great a stress on analogies, and, to the prejudice of truth, humour
          that eagerness of the mind, whereby it is carried to extend its
          knowledge into general theorems. For example, gravitation or mutual
          attraction, because it appears in many instances, some are
          straightway for pronouncing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">universal</span></em>; and that to attract and
          be attracted by every other body is an essential quality inherent
          in all bodies whatsoever. Whereas it is evident the fixed stars
          have no such tendency towards each other; and, so far is that
          gravitation from being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">essential</span></em> to bodies that in some
          instances a quite contrary principle seems to shew itself; as in
          the perpendicular growth of plants, and the elasticity of the air.
          There is nothing necessary or essential in the case<a id=

          it depends entirely on the will of the Governing Spirit<a id=

          causes certain bodies to cleave together or tend towards each other
          according to various laws, whilst He keeps others at a fixed
          distance; and to some He gives a quite contrary tendency to fly
          asunder, just as He sees convenient.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">107. After what
          has been premised, I think we may lay down the following
          conclusions. First, it is plain philosophers <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> amuse themselves in vain, when they
          enquire for any natural efficient cause, distinct from a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mind</span></em> or
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">spirit</span></em>. Secondly, considering the
          whole creation is the workmanship of a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wise and good
          Agent</span></em>, it should seem to become philosophers to employ
          their thoughts (contrary to what some hold<a id="noteref_700" name=
          "noteref_700" href="#note_700"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a>)
          about the final causes of things. [<a id="noteref_701" name=
          "noteref_701" href="#note_701"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a> For,
          besides that this would prove a very pleasing entertainment to the
          mind, it might be of great advantage, in that it not only discovers
          to us the attributes of the Creator, but may also direct us in
          several instances to the proper uses and applications of things.]
          And I must confess I see no reason why pointing out the various
          ends to which natural things are adapted, and for which they were
          originally with unspeakable wisdom contrived, should not be thought
          one good way of accounting for them, and altogether worthy a
          philosopher. Thirdly, from what has been premised, no reason can be
          drawn why the history of nature should not still be studied, and
          observations and experiments made; which, that they are of use to
          mankind, and enable us to draw any general conclusions, is not the
          result of any immutable habitudes or relations between things
          themselves, but only of God's goodness and kindness to men in the
          administration of the world. See sects. 30 and 31. Fourthly, by a
          diligent observation of the phenomena within our view, we may
          discover the general laws of nature, and from them deduce other
          phenomena. I do not say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">demonstrate</span></em>; for all deductions of
          that kind depend on a supposition that the Author of Nature always
          operates uniformly, and in a constant observance of those rules
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          carry on the resemblance.] As in reading other books a wise man
          will choose to fix his thoughts on the sense and apply it to use,
          rather than lay them out in grammatical remarks on the language;
          so, in perusing the volume of nature, methinks it is beneath the
          dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reducing each
          particular phenomenon to general rules, or shewing how it follows
          from them. We should propose to ourselves nobler views, such as to
          recreate and exalt the mind with a prospect of the beauty, order,
          extent, and variety of natural things: hence, by proper inferences,
          to enlarge our notions of the grandeur, wisdom, and beneficence of
          the Creator: and lastly, to make the several parts of the creation,
          so far as in us lies, subservient to the ends they were designed
          for—God's glory, and the sustentation and comfort of ourselves and
          fellow-creatures.</p>

          things, to which nevertheless in their own nature they bear no

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Time</span></em>, as it is there taken in an
          absolute or abstracted sense, for the duration or perseverance of
          the existence of things, I have nothing more to add concerning it
          after what has been already said on that subject. Sects. 97 and 98.
          For the rest, this celebrated author holds there is an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute
          Space</span></em>, which, being unperceivable to sense, remains in
          itself similar and immoveable; and relative space to be the measure
          thereof, which, being moveable and defined by its situation in
          respect of sensible bodies, is vulgarly taken for immoveable space.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Place</span></em> he defines to be that part
          of space which is occupied by any body: and according as the space
          is absolute or relative so also is the place. <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Absolute
          Motion</span></em> is said to be the translation of a body from
          absolute place to absolute place, as relative motion is from one
          relative place to another. And because the parts of absolute space
          do not fall under our senses, instead of them we are obliged to use
          their sensible measures; and so define both place and motion with
          respect to bodies which we regard as immoveable. But it is said, in
          philosophical matters we must abstract from our senses; since it
          may be that none of those bodies which seem to be quiescent are
          truly so; and the same thing which is moved relatively may be
          really at rest. As likewise one and the same body may be in
          relative rest and motion, or even moved with contrary relative
          motions at the same time, according as its place is variously
          defined. All which ambiguity is to be found in the apparent
          motions; but not at all in the true or absolute, which should
          therefore be alone regarded in philosophy. And the true we are told
          are distinguished from apparent or relative motions by the
          following properties. First, in true or absolute motion, all parts
          which preserve the same position with respect of the whole, partake
          of the motions of the whole. Secondly, the place being moved, that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name=
          "Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which is placed
          therein is also moved: so that a body moving in a place which is in
          motion doth participate the motion of its place. Thirdly, true
          motion is never generated or changed otherwise than by force
          impressed on the body itself. Fourthly, true motion is always
          changed by force impressed on the body moved. Fifthly, in circular
          motion, barely relative, there is no centrifugal force, which
          nevertheless, in that which is true or absolute, is proportional to
          the quantity of motion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">112. But,
          notwithstanding what hath been said, I must confess it does not
          appear to me that there can be any motion other than <em class=

          that to conceive motion there must be conceived at least two
          bodies; whereof the distance or position in regard to each other is
          varied. Hence, if there was one only body in being it could not
          possibly be moved. This seems evident, in that the idea I have of
          motion doth necessarily include relation.—[<a id="noteref_711"
          name="noteref_711" href="#note_711"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">113. But, though
          in every motion it be necessary to conceive more bodies than one,
          yet it may be that one only is moved, namely, that on which the
          force causing the change in the distance or situation of the bodies
          is impressed. For, however some may define relative motion, so as
          to term that body <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">moved</span></em> which changes its distance
          from some other body, whether the force [<a id="noteref_712" name=

          action] causing that change were impressed on it or no, yet, as
          relative motion is that which is perceived by sense, and regarded
          in the ordinary affairs of life, it follows that every man of
          common sense knows what it is as well as the best philosopher. Now,
          I ask any one whether, in his sense of motion as he walks along the
          streets, the stones he passes over may be said to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">move</span></em>,
          because they change distance with his feet? To me it appears that
          though motion includes a relation of one thing to another, yet it
          is not necessary that each term of the relation be denominated from
          it. As a man may think of somewhat which does <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">114. As the
          place happens to be variously defined, the motion which is related

          man in a ship may be said to be quiescent with relation to the
          sides of the vessel, and yet move with relation to the land. Or he
          may move eastward in respect of the one, and westward in respect of
          the other. In the common affairs of life, men never go beyond the
          Earth to define the place of any body; and what is quiescent in
          respect of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">that</span></em> is accounted <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> to be so. But
          philosophers, who have a greater extent of thought, and juster
          notions of the system of things, discover even the Earth itself to
          be moved. In order therefore to fix their notions, they seem to
          conceive the Corporeal World as finite, and the utmost unmoved
          walls or shell thereof to be the place whereby they estimate true
          motions. If we sound our own conceptions, I believe we may find all
          the absolute motion we can frame an idea of to be at bottom no
          other than relative motion thus defined. For, as has been already
          observed, absolute motion, exclusive of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
          external relation, is incomprehensible: and to this kind of
          relative motion all the above-mentioned properties, causes, and
          effects ascribed to absolute motion will, if I mistake not, be
          found to agree. As to what is said of the centrifugal force, that
          it does not at all belong to circular relative motion, I do not see
          how this follows from the experiment which is brought to prove it.
          See Newton's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica,
          in Schol. Def. VIII</span></span>. For the water in the vessel, at
          that time wherein it is said to have the greatest relative circular
          motion, hath, I think, no motion at all: as is plain from the
          foregoing section.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">115. For, to
          denominate a body <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">moved</span></em>, it is requisite, first,
          that it change its distance or situation with regard to some other
          body: and secondly, that the force occasioning that change be
          applied to<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a> it.
          If either of these be wanting, I do not think that, agreeably to
          the sense of mankind, or the propriety of language, a body
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name=
          "Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> can be said to be in
          motion. I grant indeed that it is possible for us to think a body,
          which we see change its distance from some other, to be moved,
          though it have no force applied to<a id="noteref_716" name=

          (in which sense there may be apparent motion); but then it is
          because the force causing the change<a id="noteref_717" name=

          or] impressed on that body thought to move. Which indeed shews we
          are capable of mistaking a thing to be in motion which is not, and
          that is all. [<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a>But it
          does not prove that, in the common acceptation of motion, a body is
          moved merely because it changes distance from another; since as
          soon as we are undeceived, and find that the moving force was not
          communicated to it, we no longer hold it to be moved. So, on the
          other hand, when one only body (the parts whereof preserve a given
          position between themselves) is imagined to exist, some there are
          who think that it can be moved all manner of ways, though without
          any change of distance or situation to any other bodies; which we
          should not deny, if they meant only that it might have an impressed
          force, which, upon the bare creation of other bodies, would produce
          a motion of some certain quantity and determination. But that an
          actual motion (distinct from the impressed force, or power,
          productive of change of place in case there were bodies present
          whereby to define it) can exist in such a single body, I must
          confess I am not able to comprehend.]</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">116. From what
          has been said, it follows that the philosophic consideration of
          motion doth not imply the being of an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute
          Space</span></em>, distinct from that which is perceived by sense,
          and related to bodies: which that it cannot exist without the mind
          is clear upon the same principles that demonstrate the like of all
          other objects of sense. And perhaps, if we inquire narrowly, we
          shall find we cannot even frame an idea of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure Space
          exclusive of all body</span></em>. This I must confess seems
          impossible<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href=

          "Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> being a most
          abstract idea. When I excite a motion in some part of my body, if
          it be free or without resistance, I say there is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Space</span></em>.
          But if I find a resistance, then I say there is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Body</span></em>:
          and in proportion as the resistance to motion is lesser or greater,
          I say the space is more or less <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure</span></em>.
          So that when I speak of pure or empty space, it is not to be
          supposed that the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">space</span></em> stands for an idea distinct
          from, or conceivable without, body and motion. Though indeed we are
          apt to think every noun substantive stands for a distinct idea that
          may be separated from all others; which hath occasioned infinite
          mistakes. When, therefore, supposing all the world to be
          annihilated besides my own body, I say there still remains
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pure
          Space</span></em>; thereby nothing else is meant but only that I
          conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be moved on all
          sides without the least resistance: but if that too were
          annihilated then there could be no motion, and consequently no

          Some, perhaps, may think the sense of seeing doth furnish them with
          the idea of pure space; but it is plain from what we have elsewhere
          shewn, that the ideas of space and distance are not obtained by
          that sense. See the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          here laid down seems to put an end to all those disputes and
          difficulties that have sprung up amongst the learned concerning the
          nature of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pure Space</span></em>. But the chief
          advantage arising from it is that we are freed from that dangerous
          dilemma, to which several who have employed their thoughts on that
          subject imagine themselves reduced, viz. of thinking either that
          Real Space is God, or else that there is something beside God which
          is eternal, uncreated, infinite, indivisible, immutable. Both which
          may justly be thought pernicious and absurd notions. It is certain
          that not a few divines, as well as philosophers of great note,
          have, from the difficulty they found in conceiving either limits or
          annihilation of space, concluded it must be <em class=

          And some of late have set themselves particularly to shew that the

          of mankind. Mathematicians, though they deduce their theorems from
          a great height of evidence, yet their first principles are limited
          by the consideration of Quantity. And they do not ascend into any
          inquiry concerning those transcendental maxims which influence all
          the particular sciences; each part whereof, Mathematics not
          excepted, doth consequently participate of the errors involved in
          them. That the principles laid down by mathematicians are true, and
          their way of deduction from those principles clear and
          incontestible, we do not deny. But we hold there may be certain
          erroneous maxims of greater extent than the object of Mathematics,
          and for that reason not expressly mentioned, though tacitly
          supposed, throughout the whole progress of that science; and that
          the ill effects of those secret unexamined errors are diffused
          through all the branches thereof. To be plain, we suspect the
          mathematicians are no less deeply concerned than other men in the
          errors arising from the doctrine of abstract general ideas, and the
          existence of objects without the mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">119. Arithmetic
          hath been thought to have for its object abstract ideas of

          properties and mutual habitudes, is supposed no mean part of
          speculative knowledge. The opinion of the pure and intellectual
          nature of numbers in abstract has made them <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in esteem with those philosophers who
          seem to have affected an uncommon fineness and elevation of
          thought. It hath set a price on the most trifling numerical
          speculations, which in practice are of no use, but serve only for
          amusement; and hath heretofore so far infected the minds of some,
          that they have dreamed of mighty <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mysteries</span></em> involved in numbers, and
          attempted the explication of natural things by them. But, if we
          narrowly inquire into our own thoughts, and consider what has been
          premised, we may perhaps entertain a low opinion of those high
          flights and abstractions, and look on all inquiries about numbers
          only as so many <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">difficiles
          nugae</span></span>, so far as they are not subservient to
          practice, and promote the benefit of life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">120. Unity in
          abstract we have before considered in sect. 13; from which, and
          what has been said in the Introduction, it plainly follows there is
          not any such idea. But, number being defined a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">collection of
          units</span></em>, we may conclude that, if there be no such thing
          as unity, or unit in abstract, there are no <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>
          of number in abstract, denoted by the numeral names and figures.
          The theories therefore in Arithmetic, if they are abstracted from
          the names and figures, as likewise from all use and practice, as
          well as from the particular things numbered, can be supposed to
          have nothing at all for their object. Hence we may see how entirely
          the science of numbers is subordinate to practice, and how jejune
          and trifling it becomes when considered as a matter of mere
          speculation<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">121. However,
          since there may be some who, deluded by the specious show of
          discovering abstracted verities, waste their time in arithmetical
          theorems and problems which have not any use, it will not be amiss
          if we more fully consider and expose the vanity of that pretence.
          And this will plainly appear by taking a view of Arithmetic in its
          infancy, and observing what it was that originally put men on the
          study of that science, and to what scope they directed it. It is
          natural to think that at first, men, for ease of memory and help of
          computation, made use of counters, or in writing of single strokes,
          points, or the like, each whereof was made to signify an unit, i.e.
          some one thing of whatever kind they had occasion to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reckon. Afterwards they found out the
          more compendious ways of making one character stand in place of
          several strokes or points. And, lastly, the notation of the
          Arabians or Indians came into use; wherein, by the repetition of a
          few characters or figures, and varying the signification of each
          figure according to the place it obtains, all numbers may be most
          aptly expressed. Which seems to have been done in imitation of
          language, so that an exact analogy is observed betwixt the notation
          by figures and names, the nine simple figures answering the nine
          first numeral names and places in the former, corresponding to
          denominations in the latter. And agreeably to those conditions of
          the simple and local value of figures, were contrived methods of
          finding, from the given figures or marks of the parts, what figures
          and how placed are proper to denote the whole, or <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>. And having found the
          sought figures, the same rule or analogy being observed throughout,
          it is easy to read them into words; and so the number becomes
          perfectly known. For then the number of any particular things is
          said to be known, when we know the name or figures (with their due
          arrangement) that according to the standing analogy belong to them.
          For, these signs being known, we can by the operations of
          arithmetic know the signs of any part of the particular sums
          signified by them; and thus computing in signs, (because of the
          connexion established betwixt them and the distinct multitudes of
          things, whereof one is taken for an unit), we may be able rightly
          to sum up, divide, and proportion the things themselves that we
          intend to number.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">122. In
          Arithmetic, therefore, we regard not the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>
          but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">signs</span></em>; which nevertheless are not
          regarded for their own sake, but because they direct us how to act
          with relation to things, and dispose rightly of them. Now,
          agreeably to what we have before observed of Words in general
          (sect. 19, Introd.), it happens here likewise, that abstract ideas
          are thought to be signified by numeral names or characters, while
          they do not suggest ideas of particular things to our minds. I
          shall not at present enter into a more particular dissertation on
          this subject; but only observe that it is evident from what has
          been said, those things which pass for abstract truths and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name=
          "Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> theorems concerning
          numbers, are in reality conversant about no object distinct from
          particular numerable things; except only names and characters,
          which originally came to be considered on no other account but
          their being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">signs</span></em>, or capable to represent
          aptly whatever particular things men had need to compute. Whence it
          follows that to study them for their own sake would be just as
          wise, and to as good purpose, as if a man, neglecting the true use
          or original intention and subserviency of language, should spend
          his time in impertinent criticisms upon words, or reasonings and

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          expressly laid down either as an axiom or theorem in the elements
          of that science, yet is throughout the same everywhere supposed,
          and thought to have so inseparable and essential a connexion with
          the principles and demonstrations in Geometry that mathematicians
          never admit it into doubt, or make the least question of it. And as
          this notion is the source from whence do spring all those amusing
          geometrical paradoxes which have such a direct repugnancy to the
          plain common sense of mankind, and are admitted with so much
          reluctance into a mind not yet debauched by learning; so is it the
          principal occasion of all that nice and extreme subtilty, which
          renders the study of Mathematics so very difficult and tedious.
          Hence, if we can make it appear that no <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">finite</span></em>
          extension contains innumerable parts, or is infinitely divisible,
          it follows that we shall at once clear the science of Geometry from
          a great number of difficulties and contradictions which have ever
          been esteemed a reproach to human reason, and withal make the
          attainment thereof a business of much less time and pains than it
          hitherto hath been.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">124. Every
          particular finite extension which may possibly be the object of our
          thought is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          and consequently each part thereof must be perceived. If,
          therefore, I cannot <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">perceive</span></em> innumerable parts in any
          finite extension that I consider, it is certain they are not
          contained in it. But it is evident that <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> I cannot distinguish innumerable parts in any
          particular line, surface, or solid, which I either perceive by
          sense, or figure to myself in my mind. Wherefore I conclude they
          are not contained in it. Nothing can be plainer to me than that the
          extensions I have in view are no other than my own ideas; and it is
          no less plain that I cannot resolve any one of my ideas into an
          infinite number of other ideas; that is, that they are not
          infinitely divisible<a id="noteref_727" name="noteref_727" href=

          extension</span></em> be meant something distinct from a finite
          idea, I declare I do not know what that is, and so cannot affirm or
          deny anything of it. But if the terms <em class=

          quantity or extension consists of parts infinite in number is so
          manifest and glaring a contradiction, that every one at first sight
          acknowledges it to be so. And it is impossible it should ever gain
          the assent of any reasonable creature who is not brought to it by
          gentle and slow degrees, as a converted Gentile<a id="noteref_728"

          themselves, but likewise whatever is deducible from them, thought

          the minds of geometricians as of other men, and have a like
          influence on their reasonings; and it were no difficult thing to
          shew how the arguments from Geometry made use of to support the

          observe in general whence it is the mathematicians are all so fond
          and tenacious of that doctrine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">126. It has been
          observed in another place that the theorems and demonstrations in
          Geometry are conversant about universal ideas (sect. 15, Introd.):
          where it is explained in what sense this ought to be understood, to
          wit, the particular lines and figures included in the diagram are
          supposed to stand for innumerable others of different sizes; or, in
          other words, the geometer considers them abstracting from their
          magnitude: which doth not imply that he forms an abstract idea, but
          only that he cares not what the particular magnitude is, whether
          great or small, but looks on that as a thing indifferent to the
          demonstration. Hence it follows that a line in the scheme but an
          inch long must be spoken of as though it contained ten thousand
          parts, since it is regarded not in itself, but as it is universal;
          and it is universal only in its signification, whereby it
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">represents</span></em> innumerable lines
          greater than itself, in which may be distinguished ten thousand
          parts or more, though there may not be above an inch in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em>.
          After this manner, the properties of the lines signified are (by a
          very usual figure) transferred to the sign; and thence, through
          mistake, thought to appertain to it considered in its own
          nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">127. Because
          there is no number of parts so great but it is possible there may
          be a line containing more, the inch-line is said to contain parts
          more than any assignable number; which is true, not of the inch
          taken absolutely, but only for the things signified by it. But men,
          not retaining that distinction in their thoughts, slide into a
          belief that the small particular line described on paper contains
          in itself parts innumerable. There <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> is no such thing as the ten thousandth part
          of an inch; but there is of a mile or diameter of the earth, which
          may be signified by that inch. When therefore I delineate a
          triangle on paper, and take one side, not above an inch for example
          in length, to be the radius, this I consider as divided into 10,000
          or 100,000 parts, or more. For, though the ten thousandth part of
          that line considered in itself, is nothing at all, and consequently
          may be neglected without any error or inconveniency, yet these
          described lines, being only marks standing for greater quantities,
          whereof it may be the ten thousandth part is very considerable, it
          follows that, to prevent notable errors in practice, the radius
          must be taken of 10,000 parts, or more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">128. From what
          has been said the reason is plain why, to the end any theorem may
          become universal in its use, it is necessary we speak of the lines
          described on paper as though they contained parts which really they
          do not. In doing of which, if we examine the matter throughly, we
          shall perhaps discover that we cannot conceive an inch itself as
          consisting of, or being divisible into, a thousand parts, but only
          some other line which is far greater than an inch, and represented
          by it; and that when we say a line is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">infinitely
          divisible</span></em>, we must mean<a id="noteref_732" name=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a line
          which is infinitely great</span></em>. What we have here observed
          seems to be the chief cause, why to suppose the <em class=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">finite

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">129. The several
          absurdities and contradictions which flowed from this false
          principle might, one would think, have been esteemed so many
          demonstrations against it. But, by I know not what logic, it is
          held that proofs <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

          are not to be admitted against propositions relating to Infinity.
          As though it were not impossible even for an Infinite Mind to
          reconcile contradictions; or as if anything absurd and repugnant
          could have a necessary connexion with truth, or flow from it. But
          whoever considers the weakness of this pretence, will think it was
          contrived on purpose to humour the laziness of the mind, which had
          rather acquiesce in an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg

          severe examination of those principles it has ever embraced for
          true.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">130. Of late the
          speculations about Infinites have run so high, and grown to such
          strange notions, as have occasioned no small scruples and disputes
          among the geometers of the present age. Some there are of great
          note who, not content with holding that finite lines may be divided
          into an infinite number of parts, do yet farther maintain, that
          each of those Infinitesimals is itself subdivisible into an
          infinity of other parts, or Infinitesimals of a second order, and
          so on <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad infinitum</span></span>.
          These, I say, assert there are Infinitesimals of Infinitesimals of
          Infinitesimals, without ever coming to an end. So that according to
          them an inch does not barely contain an infinite number of parts,
          but an infinity of an infinity of an infinity <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ad infinitum</span></span> of parts. Others
          there be who hold all orders of Infinitesimals below the first to
          be nothing at all; thinking it with good reason absurd to imagine
          there is any positive quantity or part of extension which, though
          multiplied infinitely, can ever equal the smallest given extension.
          And yet on the other hand it seems no less absurd to think the
          square, cube, or other power of a positive real root, should itself
          be nothing at all; which they who hold Infinitesimals of the first
          order, denying all of the subsequent orders, are obliged to
          maintain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">131. Have we not
          therefore reason to conclude they are <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> in
          the wrong, and that there is in effect no such thing as parts
          infinitely small, or an infinite number of parts contained in any
          finite quantity? But you will say that if this doctrine obtains it
          will follow the very foundations of Geometry are destroyed, and
          those great men who have raised that science to so astonishing a
          height, have been all the while building a castle in the air. To
          this it may be replied, that whatever is useful in geometry, and
          promotes the benefit of human life, does still remain firm and
          unshaken on our Principles; that science considered as practical
          will rather receive advantage than any prejudice from what has been
          said. But to set this in a due light,[<a id="noteref_733" name=

          the rest, though it should follow that some of the more intricate
          and subtle parts of Speculative Mathematics may be pared off
          without any prejudice to truth, yet I do not see what damage will
          be thence derived to mankind. On the contrary, I think it were
          highly to be wished that men of great abilities and obstinate

          draw off their thoughts from those amusements, and employ them in

          said that several theorems, undoubtedly true, are discovered by
          methods in which Infinitesimals are made use of, which could never
          have been if their existence included a contradiction in it:—I
          answer, that upon a thorough examination it will not be found that

          surfaces less than what are perceivable to sense. They may indeed
          call those little and almost insensible quantities Infinitesimals,
          or Infinitesimals of Infinitesimals, if they please. But at bottom
          this is all, they being in truth finite; nor does the solution of
          problems require the supposing any other. But this will be more

          have hitherto said, it is plain that very numerous and important
          errors have taken their rise from those false Principles which were
          impugned in the foregoing parts of this Treatise; and the opposites

          confidence. And surely if by distinguishing the real existence of
          unthinking things from their being perceived, and allowing them a
          subsistence of their own, out of the minds of spirits, no one thing
          is explained in nature, but on the contrary a great many
          inexplicable difficulties arise; if the supposition of Matter<a id=

          barely precarious, as not being grounded on so much as one single
          reason; if its consequences cannot endure the light of examination
          and free inquiry, but screen themselves under the dark and general
          pretence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          if withal the removal of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          the least evil consequence; if it be not even missed in the world,

          lastly, both Sceptics and Atheists are for ever silenced upon
          supposing only spirits and ideas, and this scheme of things is
          perfectly agreeable both to Reason and Religion: methinks we may
          expect it should be admitted and firmly embraced, though it were
          proposed only as an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">hypothesis</span></em>, and the existence of
          Matter had been allowed possible; which yet I think we have
          evidently demonstrated that it is not.</p>

          that, in consequence of the foregoing Principles, several disputes
          and speculations which are esteemed no mean parts of learning are
          rejected as useless [<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href=

          prejudice soever against our notions this may give to those who
          have already been deeply engaged, and made large advances in
          studies of that nature, yet by others we hope it will not be

          despatched what we intended to say concerning the knowledge of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>, the method we proposed
          leads us in the next place to treat of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          regard to which, perhaps, human knowledge is not so deficient as is
          vulgarly imagined. The great reason that is assigned for our being
          thought ignorant of the nature of Spirits is our not having an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em> of it. But, surely it ought
          not to be looked on as a defect in a human understanding that it
          does not perceive the idea of Spirit, if it is manifestly
          impossible there should be any such idea. And this if I mistake not
          has been demonstrated in section 27. To which I shall here add that
          a Spirit has been shewn to be the only substance or support wherein
          unthinking beings or ideas can exist: but that this <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substance</span></em> which supports or
          perceives ideas should itself be an idea, or like an idea, is
          evidently absurd.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">136. It will
          perhaps be said that we want a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sense</span></em>
          (as some have imagined<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href=
          "#note_741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a>)
          proper to know substances withal; which, if we had, we might know
          our own soul as we do a triangle. To this I answer, that in case we
          had a new sense bestowed upon us, we could only receive thereby
          some new <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensations</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideas of
          sense</span></em>. But I believe nobody will say that what he means
          by the terms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">soul</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substance</span></em> is only some particular
          sort of idea or sensation. We may therefore infer that, all things
          duly considered, it is not more reasonable to think our faculties
          defective, in that they do not furnish us with an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em> of
          Spirit, or active thinking substance, than it would be if we should
          blame them for not being able to comprehend a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">round
          square</span></em><a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">137. From the
          opinion that Spirits are to be known after the manner of an idea or
          sensation have risen many absurd and heterodox tenets, and much
          scepticism about the nature of the soul. It is even probable that
          this opinion may have produced a doubt in some whether they had any
          soul at all distinct from their body; since upon inquiry they could
          not find they had an idea of it. That an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
          which is inactive, and the existence whereof consists in being
          perceived, should be the image or likeness of an agent subsisting
          by itself, seems to need no other refutation than barely attending
          to what is meant by those words. But perhaps you will say that
          though an idea cannot resemble a Spirit in its thinking, acting, or
          subsisting by itself, yet it may in some other respects; and it is
          not necessary that an idea or image be in all respects like the
          original.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">138. I answer,
          If it does not in those mentioned, it is impossible it should
          represent it in any other thing. Do but leave out the power of
          willing, thinking, and perceiving ideas, and there remains nothing
          else wherein the idea can be like a spirit. For, by the word
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">spirit</span></em> we mean only that which
          thinks, wills, and perceives; this, and this alone, constitutes the
          signification of that term. If therefore it is impossible that any
          degree of those powers should be represented in an idea [<a id=

          notion], it is evident there can be no idea [or notion] of a
          Spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">139. But it will
          be objected that, if there is no <em class=

          signified by the terms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          insignificant, or have no meaning in them. I answer, those words do
          mean or signify a real thing; which is neither an idea nor like an
          idea, but that which perceives ideas, and wills, and reasons about
          them. What I am <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          consent called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          appellation. I answer, all the unthinking objects of the mind agree
          in that they are entirely passive, and their existence consists
          only in being perceived: whereas a <em class=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          is therefore necessary, in order to prevent equivocation and
          confounding natures perfectly disagreeing and unlike, that we

          concatenation of natural things, the surprising magnificence,
          beauty and perfection of the larger, and the exquisite contrivance
          of the smaller parts of the creation, together with the exact
          harmony and correspondence of the whole, but above all the
          never-enough-admired laws of pain and pleasure, and the instincts
          or natural inclinations, appetites, and passions of animals;—I say
          if we consider all these things, and at the same time attend to the
          meaning and import of the attributes One, Eternal, Infinitely Wise,
          Good, and Perfect, we shall clearly perceive that they belong to

          is evident that God is known as certainly and immediately as any
          other mind or spirit whatsoever, distinct from ourselves. We may
          even assert that the existence of God is far more evidently
          perceived than the existence of men; because the effects of Nature
          are infinitely more numerous and considerable than those ascribed
          to human agents. There is not any one mark that denotes a man, or

          full and clear view than we do any one of our fellow-creatures. Not
          that I imagine we see God (as some will have it) by a direct and
          immediate view; or see corporeal things, not by themselves, but by
          seeing that which represents them in the essence of God; which
          doctrine is, I must confess, to me incomprehensible<a id=

          I shall explain my meaning. A human spirit or person is not
          perceived by sense, as not being an idea. When therefore we see the
          colour, size, figure, and motions of a man, we perceive only
          certain sensations or ideas excited in our own minds; and these
          being exhibited to our view in sundry distinct collections, serve
          to mark out unto us the existence of finite and created spirits
          like ourselves. Hence it is plain we do not see a man, if by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">man</span></em> is meant, that which lives,
          moves, perceives, and thinks as we do: but only such a certain
          collection of ideas, as directs us to think there is a distinct
          principle of thought and motion, like to ourselves, accompanying
          and represented by it. And after the same manner we see
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name=
          "Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God: all the
          difference is that, whereas some one finite and narrow assemblage
          of ideas denotes a particular human mind, whithersoever we direct
          our view we do at all times and in all places perceive manifest
          tokens of the Divinity: everything we see, hear, feel, or anywise
          perceive by sense, being a sign or effect of the power of God; as
          is our perception of those very motions which are produced by
          men<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href=

          therefore plain that nothing can be more evident to any one that is
          capable of the least reflexion than the existence of God, or a
          Spirit who is intimately present to our minds, producing in them
          all that variety of ideas or sensations which continually affect
          us, on whom we have an absolute and entire dependence, in short
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in whom we live, and move, and have our

          so near and obvious to the mind, should be attained to by the
          reason of so very few, is a sad instance of the stupidity and
          inattention of men, who, though they are surrounded with such clear
          manifestations of the Deity, are yet so little affected by them
          that they seem, as it were, blinded with excess of light<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">150. But you
          will say—Hath Nature no share in the production of natural things,
          and must they be all ascribed to the immediate and sole operation
          of God? I answer, If by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visible
          series</span></em> of effects or sensations imprinted on our minds
          according to certain fixed and general laws, then it is plain that
          Nature, taken in this sense, cannot produce anything at all<a id=

          if by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nature</span></em> is meant some being
          distinct from God, as well as from the laws of nature and things
          perceived by sense, I must confess that word is to me an empty
          sound, without any intelligible meaning annexed to it. Nature, in
          this acceptation, is a vain chimera, introduced by those heathens
          who had not just notions of the omnipresence <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and infinite perfection of God. But it
          is more unaccountable that it should be received among Christians,
          professing belief in the Holy Scriptures, which constantly ascribe
          those effects to the immediate hand of God that heathen
          philosophers are wont to impute to Nature. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Lord, He causeth the vapours to ascend; He maketh
          lightnings with rain; He bringeth forth the wind out of His
          treasures.”</span> Jerem. x. 13. <span class="tei tei-q">“He
          turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day
          dark with night.”</span> Amos v. 8. <span class="tei tei-q">“He
          visiteth the earth, and maketh it soft with showers: He blesseth
          the springing thereof, and crowneth the year with His goodness; so
          that the pastures are clothed with flocks, and the valleys are
          covered over with corn.”</span> See Psal. lxv. But, notwithstanding
          that this is the constant language of Scripture, yet we have I know
          not what aversion from believing that God concerns Himself so
          nearly in our affairs. Fain would we suppose Him at a great
          distance off, and substitute some blind unthinking deputy in His
          stead; though (if we may believe Saint Paul) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He be not far from every one of us.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">151. It will, I
          doubt not, be objected that the slow, gradual, and roundabout
          methods observed in the production of natural things do not seem to
          have for their cause the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          Agent: besides, monsters, untimely births, fruits blasted in the
          blossom, rains falling in desert places, miseries incident to human
          life, and the like, are so many arguments that the whole frame of
          nature is not immediately actuated and superintended by a Spirit of
          infinite wisdom and goodness. But the answer to this objection is
          in a good measure plain from sect. 62; it being visible that the
          aforesaid methods of nature are absolutely necessary in order to
          working by the most simple and general rules, and after a steady
          and consistent manner; which argues both the wisdom and goodness of

          it doth hence follow that the finger of God is not so conspicuous
          to the resolved and careless sinner; which gives him an opportunity
          to harden in his impiety and grow ripe for vengeance. (Vid. sect.
          57.)] Such is the artificial contrivance of this mighty

          that, whilst its motions and various phenomena strike on our

          to an unbiassed and attentive mind, nothing can be more plainly
          legible than the intimate presence of an All-wise Spirit, who
          fashions, regulates, and sustains the whole system of Being. It is
          clear, from what we have elsewhere observed, that the operating
          according to general and stated laws is so necessary for our
          guidance in the affairs of life, and letting us into the secret of
          nature, that without it all reach and compass of thought, all human
          sagacity and design, could serve to no manner of purpose. It were
          even impossible there should be any such faculties or powers in the
          mind. See sect. 31. Which one consideration abundantly outbalances
          whatever particular inconveniences may thence arise<a id=

          further consider, that the very blemishes and defects of nature are
          not without their use, in that they make an agreeable sort of
          variety, and augment the beauty of the rest of the creation, as
          shades in a picture serve to set off the brighter and more
          enlightened parts. We would likewise do well to examine, whether
          our taxing the waste of seeds and embryos, and accidental
          destruction of plants and animals before they come to full
          maturity, as an imprudence in the Author of nature, be not the
          effect of prejudice contracted by our familiarity with impotent and
          saving mortals. In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          those things which he cannot procure without much pains and

          inexplicably fine machine of an animal or vegetable costs the great
          Creator any more pains or trouble in its production than a pebble
          does; nothing being more evident than that an Omnipotent Spirit can

          it is plain that the splendid profusion of natural things should
          not be interpreted weakness or prodigality in the Agent who
          produces them, but rather be looked on as an argument of the riches
          of His power.</p>

          necessary to our well-being. But our prospects are too narrow. We

          we are affected with pain and pleasure, the nature of human
          freedom, and the design with which we are put into the world; we
          shall be forced to acknowledge that those particular things which,
          considered in themselves, appear to be evil, have the nature of
          good, when considered as linked with the whole system of

          be found. Little and unreflecting souls may indeed burlesque the

          by an aversion of thought, a wilful shutting of the eyes, we may
          not escape seeing it? Is it therefore to be wondered at, if the
          generality of men, who are ever intent on business or pleasure, and
          little used to fix or open the eye of their mind, should not have
          all that conviction and evidence of the Being of God which might be

          enlightened with a thorough sense of the omnipresence, holiness,
          and justice of that Almighty Spirit should persist in a remorseless
          violation of His laws. We ought, therefore, earnestly to meditate
          and dwell on those important points; that so we may attain

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This work is the
          gem of British metaphysical literature. Berkeley's claim to be the
          great modern master of Socratic dialogue rests, perhaps, upon
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alciphron</span></span>, which surpasses the
          conversations between Hylas and Philonous in expression of
          individual character, and in dramatic effect. Here conversation is
          adopted as a convenient way of treating objections to the
          conception of the reality of Matter which had been unfolded
          systematically in the book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>. But the lucid
          thought, the colouring of fancy, the glow of human sympathy, and
          the earnestness that pervade the subtle reasonings pursued through
          these dialogues, are unique in English metaphysical literature.
          Except perhaps Hume and Ferrier, none approach Berkeley in the art
          of uniting metaphysical thought with easy, graceful, and
          transparent style. Our surprise and admiration are increased when
          we recollect that this charming production of reason and
          imagination came from Ireland, at a time when that country was
          scarcely known in the world of letters and philosophy.</p>

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, is shewn in
          Berkeley's correspondence with Sir John Percival. Berkeley was
          eager to hear what people had to say for or against what looked
          like a paradox apt to shock the reader; but in those days he was
          not immediately informed by professional critics. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If when you receive my book”</span>—he wrote from
          Dublin in July, 1710, to Sir John Percival<a id="noteref_777" name=

          in London,—<span class="tei tei-q">“you can procure me the opinion
          of some of your acquaintances who are thinking men, addicted to the
          study of natural philosophy and mathematics, I shall be extremely
          obliged to you.”</span> In the following month he was informed by
          Sir John that it was <span class="tei tei-q">“incredible what
          prejudice can work in the best geniuses, even in the lovers of
          novelty. For I did but name the subject matter of your book of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> to some ingenious
          friends of mine and they immediately treated it with ridicule, at
          the same time refusing to read it, which I have not yet got one to
          do. A physician of my acquaintance undertook to discover your
          person, and argued you must needs be mad, and that you ought to
          take remedies. A bishop pitied you, that a desire of starting
          something new should put you upon such an undertaking. Another told
          me that you are not gone so far as a gentleman in town, who asserts
          not only that there is no such thing as Matter, but that we
          ourselves have no being at all.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's reply
          is interesting. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not
          surprised,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I should
          be ridiculed by those who won't take the pains to understand me. If
          the raillery and scorn of those who criticise what they will not be
          at the pains to understand had been sufficient to deter men from
          making any attempts towards curing the ignorance and errors of
          mankind, we should not have been troubled with some very fair
          improvements in knowledge. The common <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> cry's being against any opinion seems to me,
          so far from proving false, that it may with as good reason pass for
          an argument of its truth. However, I imagine that whatever doctrine
          contradicts vulgar and settled opinion had need be introduced with
          great caution into the world. For this reason it was that I omitted
          all mention of the non-existence of Matter in the title-page,
          dedication, preface and introduction to the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Treatise on the
          Principles of Human Knowledge</span></span>; that so the notion
          might steal unawares upon the reader, who probably might never have
          meddled with the book if he had known that it contained such
          paradoxes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With
          characteristic fervour he disclaims <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“variety and love of paradox”</span> as motives of the
          book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span>, and professes faith
          in the unreality of abstract unperceived Matter, a faith which he
          has held for some years, <span class="tei tei-q">“the conceit being
          at first warm in my imagination, but since carefully examined, both
          by my own judgment and that of ingenious friends.”</span> What he
          especially complained of was <span class="tei tei-q">“that men who
          have never considered my book should confound me with the sceptics,
          who doubt the existence of sensible things, and are not positive as
          to any one truth, no, not so much as their own being—which I find
          by your letter is the case of some wild visionist now in London.
          But whoever reads my book with attention will see that there is a
          direct opposition between the principles that are contained in it
          and those of the sceptics, and that I question not the existence of
          anything we perceive by our senses. I do not deny the existence of
          the sensible things which Moses says were created by God. They
          existed from all eternity, in the Divine Intellect; and they became
          perceptible (i.e. were created) in the same manner and order as is
          described in Genesis. For I take creation to belong to things only
          as they respect finite spirits; there being nothing new to God.
          Hence it follows that the act of creation consists in <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God's willing that those things should
          become perceptible to other spirits which before were known only to
          Himself. Now both reason and scripture assure us that there
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">are</span></em> other spirits besides men,
          who, 'tis possible, might have perceived this visible world as it
          was successively exhibited to their view before man's creation.
          Besides, for to agree with the Mosaic account of the creation, it's
          sufficient if we suppose that a man, in case he was existing at the
          time of the chaos of sensible things, might have perceived all
          things formed out of it, in the very order set down in scripture;
          all which is in no way repugnant to my principles.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sir John in his
          next letter, written from London in October, 1716, reports that the
          book of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> had fallen into the
          hands of the highest living English authority in metaphysical
          theology, Samuel Clarke, who had produced his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Demonstration of the
          Being and Attributes of God</span></span> four years before. The
          book had also been read by Whiston, Newton's successor at
          Cambridge. <span class="tei tei-q">“I can only report at
          second-hand,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“that they
          think you a fair arguer, and a clear writer; but they say your
          first principles you lay down are false. They look upon you as an
          extraordinary genius, ranking you with Father Malebranche, Norris,
          and another whose name I forget, all of whom they think
          extraordinary men, but of a particular turn of mind, and their
          labours of little use to mankind, on account of their abstruseness.
          This may arise from these gentlemen not caring to think after a new
          manner, which would oblige them to begin their studies anew; or
          else it may be the strength of prejudice.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley was
          vexed by this treatment on the part of Clarke and Whiston. He sent
          under Sir John's care a letter to each of them, hoping through him
          to discover <span class="tei tei-q">“their reasons against his
          notions, as truth is his sole aim.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As to what is said of ranking me with Father
          Malebranche <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
          355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and Mr. Norris, whose writings are thought to be too fine-spun to
          be of any great use to mankind, I have this answer, that I think
          the notions I embrace are not in the least agreeing with theirs,
          but indeed plainly inconsistent with them in the main points,
          inasmuch as I know few writers I take myself at bottom to differ
          more from than from them. Fine-spun metaphysics are what on all
          occasions I declare against, and if any one shall shew anything of
          that sort in my Treatise I will willingly correct it.”</span> Sir
          John delivered the letters to two friends of Clarke and Whiston,
          and reported that <span class="tei tei-q">“Dr. Clarke told his
          friend in reply, that he did not care to write you his thoughts,
          because he was afraid it might draw him into a dispute upon a
          matter which was already clear to him. He thought your first
          principles you go on are false; but he was a modest man, his friend
          said, and uninclined to shock any one whose opinions on things of
          this nature differed from his own.”</span> This was a
          disappointment to the ardent Berkeley. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dr.
          Clarke's conduct seems a little surprising,”</span> he replies.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“That an ingenious and candid person (as I
          take him to be) should refuse to shew me where my error lies is
          something unaccountable. I never expected that a gentleman
          otherwise so well employed as Dr. Clarke should think it worth his
          while to enter into a dispute with me concerning any notions of
          mine. But, seeing it was clear to him I went upon false principles,
          I hoped he would vouchsafe, in a line or two, to point them out to
          me, that so I may more closely review and examine them. If he but
          once did me this favour, he need not apprehend I should give him
          any further trouble. I should be glad if you have opportunity that
          you would let his friend know this. There is nothing that I more
          desire than to know thoroughly all that can be said against what I
          take for truth.”</span> Clarke, however, was not to be drawn. The
          incident is thus referred to by Whiston, in his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Memoirs</span></span>
          of Clarke. <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Berkeley,”</span> he
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name=
          "Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> says, <span class=

          that matter was not a real thing<a id="noteref_778" name=

          that the common opinion of its reality was groundless, if not
          ridiculous. He was pleased to send Mr. Clarke and myself each of us
          a book. After we had perused it, I went to Mr. Clarke to discourse
          with him about it, to this effect, that I, being not a
          metaphysician, was not able to answer Mr. Berkeley's subtle
          premises, though I did not believe his absurd conclusions. I
          therefore desired that he, who was deep in such subtleties, but did
          not appear to believe Mr. Berkeley's conclusion, would answer him.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Which

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What Clarke's
          criticism of Berkeley might have been is suggested by the following
          sentences in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Remarks on Human Liberty</span></span>,
          published seven years after this correspondence: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The case as to the proof of our free agency is exactly
          the same as in that notable question, whether the [material] world
          exists or no? There is no demonstration of it from experience.
          There always remains a bare possibility that the Supreme Being may
          have so framed my mind, that I shall always be necessarily deceived
          in every one of my perceptions as in a dream—though possibly there
          be no material world, nor any other creature existing besides
          myself. And yet no man in his senses argues from thence, that
          experience is no proof to us of the existence of things. The bare
          physical possibility too of our being so framed by the Author of
          Nature as to be unavoidably deceived in this matter by every
          experience of every action we perform, is no more any ground to
          doubt the truth of our liberty, than the bare natural possibility
          of our being all our lifetime in a dream, deceived in our [natural]
          belief of the existence of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the material world, is any just ground to
          doubt the reality of its existence.”</span> Berkeley would hardly
          have accepted this analogy. Does the conception of a material world
          being dependent on percipient mind for its reality imply <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">deception</span></em> on the part of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Supreme Being”</span>? <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dreams,”</span> in ordinary language, may signify
          illusory fancies during sleep, and so understood the term is
          misapplied to a universally mind-dependent universe with its steady
          natural order. Berkeley disclaims emphatically any doubt of the
          reality of the sensible world, and professes only to shew in what
          its reality consists, or its dependence upon percipient life as the
          indispensable realising factor. To suppose that we can be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“necessarily deceived in every one of our
          perceptions”</span> is to interpret the universe atheistically, and
          virtually obliges us in final nescience to acknowledge that it is
          wholly uninterpretable; so that experience is impossible, because
          throughout unintelligible. The moral trustworthiness or perfect
          goodness of the Universal Power is I suppose the fundamental
          postulate of science and human life. If all our temporal experience
          can be called a dream it must at any rate be a dream of the sort
          supposed by Leibniz. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nullo argumento

          unmeaning character and sceptical tendency of the common

          which is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          exist in absolute independence of perceiving mind. The

          to man—the primary qualities not less than the secondary—having
          real existence in a mindless or unspiritual universe is argued and
          illustrated in detail. Abstract Matter, unrealised in terms of
          percipient life, is meaningless, and the material world becomes
          real only in and through living perception. And Matter, as an
          abstract substance without qualities, cannot, without a
          contradiction, it is also argued, be presented or represented, in
          sense. What is called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          spiritual solution, from which it issues the flexible and

          are; whose faculties moreover are educated in interpreting the
          cosmical order of the phenomena presented to their senses.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Second
          Dialogue</span></span> is in the first place directed against
          modifications of the scholastic account of Matter, which attributes
          our knowledge of it to inference, founded on sense-ideas assumed to
          be representative, or not presentative of the reality. The
          advocates of Matter independent and supreme, are here assailed in
          their various conjectures—that this Matter may be the active Cause,
          or the Instrument, or the Occasion of our sense-experience; or that
          it is an Unknowable Something somehow connected with that
          experience. It is argued in this and in the preceding Dialogue, by
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Philonous</span></span> (who personates
          Berkeley), that unrealised Matter—intending by that term either a
          qualified substance, or a Something of which we cannot affirm
          anything—is not merely unproved, but a proved impossibility: it
          must mean nothing, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg
          359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          or it must mean a contradiction, which comes to the same thing. It
          is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">perceived</span></em>; nor can it be
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          reason. The only consistent theory of the universe accordingly
          implies that concrete realities must all be either (a) phenomena
          presented to the senses, or else (b) active spirits percipient of
          presented phenomena. And neither of these two sorts of concrete
          realities is strictly speaking independent of the other; although
          the latter, identical amid the variations of the sensuous
          phenomena, are deeper and more real than the mere data of the
          senses. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Second Dialogue</span></span> ends by
          substituting, as concrete and intelligible Realism, the universal
          and constant dependence of the material world upon active living
          Spirit, in place of the abstract hypothetical and unintelligible
          Realism, which defends Matter unrealised in percipient life, as the
          type of reality.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Third
          Dialogue</span></span> plausible objections to this conception of
          what the reality of the material world means are discussed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is it said that
          the new conception is sceptical, and Berkeley another Protagoras,
          on account of it? His answer is, that the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em>
          of sensible things, as far as man can in any way be concerned with
          them, does not consist in what cannot be perceived, suggested,
          demonstrated, or even conceived, but in phenomena actually seen and
          touched, and in the working faith that future sense-experience may
          be anticipated by the analogies of present sense-experience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But is not this
          negation of the Matter that is assumed to be real and independent
          of Spirit, an unproved conjecture? It is answered, that the
          affirmation of this abstract matter is itself a mere conjecture,
          and one self-convicted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg
          360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          by its implied contradictions, while its negation is only a simple
          falling back on the facts of experience, without any attempt to
          explain them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, is it
          objected that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reality</span></em> of sensible things
          involves their continued reality during intervals of our perception
          of them? It is answered, that sensible things are indeed
          permanently dependent on Mind, but not on this, that, or the other
          finite embodied spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is it further
          alleged that the reality of Spirit or Mind is open to all the
          objections against independent Matter; and that, if we deny
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">this</span></em> Matter, we must in
          consistency allow that Spirit can be only a succession of isolated
          feelings? The answer is, that there is no parity between
          self-conscious Spirit, and Matter out of all relation to any
          Spirit. We find, in memory, our own personality and identity; that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">we</span></em> are not our ideas, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“but somewhat else”</span>—a thinking, active
          principle, that perceives, knows, wills, and operates about ideas,
          and that is revealed as continuously real. Each person is conscious
          of himself; and may reasonably infer the existence of other
          self-conscious persons, more or less like what he is conscious of
          in himself. A universe of self-conscious persons, with their common
          sensuous experiences all under cosmical order, is not open to the
          contradictions involved in a pretended universe of Matter,
          independent of percipient realising Spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is it still said
          that sane people cannot help distinguishing between the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real
          existence</span></em> of a thing and its <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being
          perceived</span></em>? It is answered, that all they are entitled
          to mean is, to distinguish between being perceived exclusively by
          me, and being independent of the perception of all sentient or
          conscious beings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Does an objector
          complain that this ideal realism dissolves the distinction between
          facts and fancies? He is reminded of the meaning of the word
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em>. That term <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is not limited by Berkeley to chimeras
          of fancy: it is applied also to the objective phenomena of our
          sense-experience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is the
          supposition that Spirit is the only real Cause of all changes in
          nature declaimed against as baseless? It is answered, that the
          supposition of unthinking Power at the heart of the cosmos of
          sensible phenomena is absurd.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is the negation
          of Abstract Matter repugnant to the common belief of mankind? It is
          argued in reply, that this unrealised Matter is foreign to common
          belief, which is incapable of even entertaining the conception; and
          which only requires to reflect upon what it does entertain to be
          satisfied with a relative or ideal reality for sensible things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, if sensible
          things are the real things, the real moon, for instance, it is
          alleged, can be only a foot in diameter. It is maintained, in
          opposition to this, that the term <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real
          moon</span></em> is applied only to what is an inference from the
          moon, one foot in diameter, which we immediately perceive; and that
          the former is a part of our previsive or mediate inference, due to
          what is perceived.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dispute,
          after all, is merely verbal, it is next objected; and, since all
          parties refer the data of the senses and the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>
          which they compose to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a</span></em> Power external to each finite
          percipient, why not call that Power, whatever it may be, Matter,
          and not Spirit? The reply is, that this would be an absurd
          misapplication of language.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But may we not,
          it is next suggested, assume the possibility of a third
          nature—neither idea nor Spirit? Not, replies Philonous, if we are
          to keep to the rule of having meaning in the words we use. We know
          what is meant by a spirit, for each of us has immediate experience
          of one; and we know what is meant by sense-ideas and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sensible things, for we have immediate
          and mediate experience of them. But we have no immediate, and
          therefore can have no mediate, experience of what is neither
          perceived by our senses, nor realised in inward consciousness:
          moreover, <span class="tei tei-q">“entia non sunt multiplicanda
          praeter necessitatem.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, this
          conception of the realities implies, it is said, imperfection,
          because sentient experience, in God. This objection, it is
          answered, implies a confusion between being actually sentient and
          merely conceiving sensations, and employing them, as God does, as
          signs for expressing His conceptions to our minds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, the
          negation of independent powerful Matter seems to annihilate the
          explanations of physical phenomena given by natural philosophers.
          But, to be assured that it does not, we have only to recollect what
          physical explanation means—that it is the reference of an
          apparently irregular phenomenon to some acknowledged general rule
          of co-existence or succession among sense-ideas. It is
          interpretation of sense-signs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is the proposed
          ideal Realism summarily condemned as a novelty? It can be answered,
          that all discoveries are novelties at first; and moreover that this
          one is not so much a novelty as a deeper interpretation of the
          common faith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet it seems, at
          any rate, it is said, to change real things into mere ideas. Here
          consider on the contrary what we mean when we speak of sensible
          things as real. The changing appearances of which we are percipient
          in sense, united objectively in their cosmical order, are what is
          truly meant by the realities of sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this reality
          is inconsistent with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">continued identity</span></em> of material
          things, it is complained, and also with the fact that different
          persons can be percipient of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same</span></em>
          thing. Not so, Berkeley explains, when we attend to the true
          meaning of the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">same</span></em>, and dismiss from
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name=
          "Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> our thoughts a
          supposed abstract idea of identity which is nonsensical.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But some may
          exclaim against the supposition that the material world exists in
          mind, regarding this as an implied assertion that mind is extended,
          and therefore material. This proceeds, it is replied, on
          forgetfulness of what <span class="tei tei-q">“existence in
          mind”</span> means. It is intended to express the fact that matter
          is real in being an objective appearance of which a living mind is
          sensible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, is not
          the Mosaic account of the creation of Matter inconsistent with the
          perpetual dependence of Matter for its reality upon percipient
          Spirit? It is answered that the conception of creation being
          dependent on the existence of finite minds is in perfect harmony
          with the Mosaic account: it is what is seen and felt, not what is
          unseen and unfelt, that is created.</p>

          common sense; and the one-sided proposition of the philosophers. It
          agrees with the mass of mankind in holding that the material world
          is actually presented to our senses, and with the philosophers in
          holding that this same material world is realised only in and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most of the
          objections to Berkeley's conception of Matter which have been urged
          in the last century and a half, by its British, French, and German
          critics, are discussed by anticipation in these <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span>. The history of
          objections is very much a history of misconceptions. Conceived or
          misconceived, it has tacitly simplified and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> purified the methods of physical
          science, especially in Britain and France.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
          elaborate criticism of Berkeley by a British author is found in
          Andrew Baxter's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Inquiry into the Nature of the Human
          Soul</span></span>, published in 1735, in the section entitled
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Dean Berkeley's Scheme against the
          existence of Matter examined, and shewn to be inconclusive.”</span>
          Baxter alleges that the new doctrine tends to encourage scepticism.
          To deny Matter, for the reasons given, involves, according to this
          critic, denial of mind, and so a universal doubt. Accordingly, a
          few years later, Hume sought, in his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Treatise of Human
          Nature</span></span>, to work out Berkeley's negation of abstract
          Matter into sceptical phenomenalism—against which Berkeley sought
          to guard by anticipation, in a remarkable passage introduced in his
          last edition of these <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Scotland the
          writings of Reid, Beattie, Oswald, Dugald Stewart, Thomas Brown,
          and Sir W. Hamilton form a magazine of objections. Reid—who
          curiously seeks to refute Berkeley by refuting, not more clearly
          than Berkeley had done before him, the hypothesis of a wholly
          representative sense-perception—urges the spontaneous belief or
          common sense of mankind, which obliges us all to recognise a direct
          presentation of the external material world to our senses. He
          overlooks what with Berkeley is the only question in debate,
          namely, the meaning of the term <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">external</span></em>; for, Reid and Berkeley
          are agreed in holding to the reality of a world regulated
          independently of the will of finite percipients, and is
          sufficiently objective to be a medium of social intercourse. With
          Berkeley, as with Reid, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">this</span></em> is practically self-evident.
          The same objection, more scientifically defined—that we have a
          natural belief in the existence of Matter, and in our own immediate
          perception of its qualities—is Sir W. Hamilton's assumption against
          Berkeley; but Hamilton does not explain the reality thus
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name=
          "Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> claimed for it.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Men naturally believe,”</span> he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">they themselves</span></em> exist—because they
          are conscious of a Self or Ego; they believe that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something different
          from themselves</span></em> exists—because they believe that they
          are conscious of this Not-self or Non-ego.”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Discussions</span></span>, p. 193.) Now, the
          existence of a Power that is independent of each finite Ego is at
          the root of Berkeley's principles. According to Berkeley and
          Hamilton alike, we are immediately percipient of solid and extended
          phenomena; but with Berkeley the phenomena are dependent on, at the
          same time that they are <span class="tei tei-q">“entirely
          distinct”</span> from, the percipient. The Divine and finite
          spirits, signified by the phenomena that are presented to our
          senses in cosmical order, form Berkeley's external world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That Berkeley
          sows the seeds of Universal Scepticism; that his conception of
          Matter involves the Panegoism or Solipsism which leaves me in
          absolute solitude; that his is virtually a system of Pantheism,
          inconsistent with personal individuality and moral
          responsibility—these are probably the three most comprehensive
          objections that have been alleged against it. They are in a measure
          due to Berkeley's imperfect criticism of first principles, in his
          dread of a departure from the concrete data of experience in quest
          of empty abstractions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In England and
          France, Berkeley's criticism of Matter, taken however only on its
          negative side, received a countenance denied to it in Germany.
          Hartley and Priestley shew signs of affinity with Berkeley. Also an
          anonymous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Essay on the Nature and Existence of the
          Material World</span></span>, dedicated to Dr. Priestley and Dr.
          Price, which appeared in 1781, is an argument, on empirical
          grounds, which virtually makes the data of the senses at last a
          chaos of isolated sensations. The author of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay</span></span>
          is said to have been a certain <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          end of the eighteenth century. A tendency towards Berkeley's
          negations, but apart from his synthetic principles, appears in
          James Mill and J.S. Mill. So too with Voltaire and the
          Encyclopedists.</p>

          conceptions of the material world which verbally at least have much
          in common, is a curious coincidence. It shews that the intellectual
          atmosphere of the Lockian epoch in England contained elements
          favourable to a reconsideration of the ultimate meaning of Matter.
          They are both the genuine produce of the age of Locke and
          Malebranche. Neither Berkeley nor Collier were, when they published
          their books, familiar with ancient Greek speculations; those of
          modern Germany had only begun to loom in the distance. Absolute
          Idealism, the Panphenomenalism of Auguste Comte, and the modern
          evolutionary conception of nature, have changed the conditions
          under which the universal problem is studied, and are making
          intelligible to this generation a manner of conceiving the Universe
          which, for nearly a century and a half, the British and French
          critics of Berkeley were unable to entertain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Berkeley's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> appeared three years
          before the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Clavis Universalis</span></span>. Yet Collier
          tells us that it was <span class="tei tei-q">“after a ten years'
          pause and deliberation,”</span> that, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“rather than the world should finish its course without
          once offering to inquire in what manner it exists,”</span> he had
          <span class="tei tei-q">“resolved <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to put himself upon the trial of the common
          reader, without pretending to any better art of gaining him than
          dry reason and metaphysical demonstration.”</span> Mr. Benson, his
          biographer, says that it was in 1703, at the age of twenty-three,
          that Collier came to the conclusion that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there is no such thing as an external world”</span>;
          and he attributes the premises from which Collier drew this
          conclusion to his neighbour, John Norris. Among Collier's MSS.,
          there remains the outline of an essay, in three chapters, dated
          January, 1708, on the non-externality of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visible</span></em>
          world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
          several coincidences between Berkeley and Collier. Berkeley
          virtually presented his new theory of Vision as the first
          instalment of his explanation of the Reality of Matter. The first
          of the two Parts into which Collier's <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clavis</span></span>
          is divided consists of proofs that the Visible World is not, and
          cannot be, external. Berkeley, in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> and the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span>, explains the reality
          of Matter. In like manner the Second Part of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clavis</span></span>
          consists of reasonings in proof of the impossibility of an external
          world independent of Spirit. Finally, in his full-blown theory, as
          well as in its visual germ, Berkeley takes for granted, as
          intuitively known, the existence of sensible Matter; meaning by
          this, its relative existence, or dependence on living Mind. The
          third proposition of Collier's system asserts the real existence of
          visible matter in particular, and of sensible matter in
          general.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The invisibility
          of distances, as well as of real magnitudes and situations, and
          their suggestion by interpretation of visual symbols, propositions
          which occupy so large a space in Berkeley's Theory of Vision, have
          no counterpart in Collier. His proof of the non-externality of the
          visible world consists of an induction of instances of visible
          objects that are allowed by all not to be external, although they
          seem to be as much so as any that are called external. His
          Demonstration consists of nine proofs, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> which may be compared with the reasonings and
          analyses of Berkeley. Collier's Demonstration concludes with
          answers to objections, and an application of his account of the
          material world to the refutation of the Roman doctrine of the
          substantial existence of Christ's body in the Eucharist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The universal
          sense-symbolism of Berkeley, and his pervading recognition of the
          distinction between physical or symbolical, and efficient or
          originative causation, are wanting in the narrow reasonings of
          Collier. Berkeley's more comprehensive philosophy, with its human
          sympathies and beauty of style, is now recognised as a striking
          expression and partial solution of fundamental problems, while
          Collier is condemned to the obscurity of the Schools<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though it seems
          the general opinion of the world, no less than the design of nature
          and providence, that the end of speculation be Practice, or the
          improvement and regulation of our lives and actions; yet those who
          are most addicted to speculative studies, seem as generally of
          another mind. And indeed if we consider the pains that have been
          taken to perplex the plainest things, that distrust of the senses,
          those doubts and scruples, those abstractions and refinements that
          occur in the very entrance of the sciences; it will not seem
          strange that men of leisure and curiosity should lay themselves out
          in fruitless disquisitions, without descending to the practical
          parts of life, or informing themselves in the more necessary and
          important parts of knowledge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon the common
          principles of philosophers, we are not assured of the existence of
          things from their being perceived. And we are taught to distinguish
          their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">real</span></em> nature from that which falls
          under our senses. Hence arise scepticism and paradoxes. It is not
          enough that we see and feel, that we taste and smell a thing: its
          true nature, its absolute external entity, is still concealed. For,
          though it be the fiction of our own brain, we have made it
          inaccessible to all our faculties. Sense is fallacious, reason
          defective. We spend our lives in doubting of those things which
          other men evidently know, and believing those things which they
          laugh at and despise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order,
          therefore, to divert the busy mind of man from vain researches, it
          seemed necessary to inquire into the source of its perplexities;
          and, if possible, to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg
          376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          lay down such Principles as, by an easy solution of them, together
          with their own native evidence, may at once recommend themselves
          for genuine to the mind, and rescue it from those endless pursuits
          it is engaged in. Which, with a plain demonstration of the
          Immediate Providence of an all-seeing God, and the natural
          Immortality of the soul, should seem the readiest preparation, as
          well as the strongest motive, to the study and practice of
          virtue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This design I
          proposed in the First Part of a treatise concerning the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles of Human Knowledge</span></span>,
          published in the year 1710. But, before I proceed to publish the
          Second Part<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785" href=
          "#note_785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a>, I
          thought it requisite to treat more clearly and fully of certain
          Principles laid down in the First, and to place them in a new
          light. Which is the business of the following <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
          Treatise, which does not presuppose in the reader any knowledge of
          what was contained in the former, it has been my aim to introduce
          the notions I advance into the mind in the most easy and familiar
          manner; especially because they carry with them a great opposition
          to the prejudices of philosophers, which have so far prevailed
          against the common sense and natural notions of mankind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the
          Principles which I here endeavour to propagate are admitted for
          true, the consequences which, I think, evidently flow from thence
          are, that Atheism and Scepticism will be utterly destroyed, many
          intricate points made plain, great difficulties solved, several
          useless parts of science retrenched, speculation referred to
          practice, and men reduced from paradoxes to common sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And although it
          may, perhaps, seem an uneasy reflexion to some, that when they have
          taken a circuit through so many refined and unvulgar notions, they
          should at last come to think like other men; yet, methinks, this
          return to the simple dictates of nature, after having wandered
          through the wild mazes of philosophy, is not unpleasant. It is like
          coming home from a long voyage: a man reflects with pleasure on the
          many difficulties <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg
          377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and perplexities he has passed through, sets his heart at ease, and
          enjoys himself with more satisfaction for the future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As it was my
          intention to convince Sceptics and Infidels by reason, so it has
          been my endeavour strictly to observe the most rigid laws of
          reasoning. And, to an impartial reader, I hope it will be manifest
          that the sublime notion of a God, and the comfortable expectation
          of Immortality, do naturally arise from a close and methodical
          application of thought: whatever may be the result of that loose,
          rambling way, not altogether improperly termed Free-thinking by
          certain libertines in thought, who can no more endure the
          restraints of logic than those of religion or government.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will perhaps
          be objected to my design that, so far as it tends to ease the mind
          of difficult and useless inquiries, it can affect only a few
          speculative persons. But if, by their speculations rightly placed,
          the study of morality and the law of nature were brought more into
          fashion among men of parts and genius, the discouragements that
          draw to Scepticism removed, the measures of right and wrong
          accurately defined, and the principles of Natural Religion reduced
          into regular systems, as artfully disposed and clearly connected as
          those of some other sciences; there are grounds to think these
          effects would not only have a gradual influence in repairing the
          too much defaced sense of virtue in the world, but also, by shewing
          that such parts of revelation as lie within the reach of human
          inquiry are most agreeable to right reason, would dispose all
          prudent, unprejudiced persons to a modest and wary treatment of
          those sacred mysteries which are above the comprehension of our
          faculties.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains that
          I desire the reader to withhold his censure of these <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span> till he has read them
          through. Otherwise, he may lay them aside in a mistake of their
          design, or on account of difficulties or objections which he would
          find answered in the sequel. A Treatise of this nature would
          require to be once read over coherently, in order to comprehend its
          design, the proofs, solution of difficulties, and the connexion and
          disposition of its parts. If it be thought to deserve a second
          reading, this, I imagine, will make the entire scheme very plain.

          It happened well, to let you see what innocent and agreeable
          pleasures you lose every morning. Can there be a pleasanter time of
          the day, or a more delightful season of the year? That purple sky,
          those wild but sweet notes of birds, the fragrant bloom upon the
          trees and flowers, the gentle influence of the rising sun, these
          and a thousand nameless beauties of nature inspire the soul with
          secret transports; its faculties too being at this time fresh and
          lively, are fit for those meditations, which the solitude of a
          garden and tranquillity of the morning naturally dispose us to. But

          to go on in the same vein; not that I would by any means deprive

          was considering the odd fate of those men who have in all ages,
          through an affectation of being distinguished from the vulgar, or
          some unaccountable turn of thought, pretended either to believe
          nothing at all, or to believe the most extravagant things in the
          world. This however might be borne, if their paradoxes and
          scepticism did not draw after them some consequences of general
          disadvantage to mankind. But the mischief lieth here; that when men
          of less leisure see them who are supposed to have spent their whole
          time in the pursuits of knowledge professing an entire ignorance of
          all things, or advancing such notions as are repugnant to plain and
          commonly received principles, they will be tempted to entertain
          suspicions concerning the most important truths, which they had
          hitherto held sacred and unquestionable<a id="noteref_786" name=

          entirely agree with you, as to the ill tendency of the affected

          quitted several of the sublime notions I had got in their schools
          for vulgar opinions. And I give it you on my word; since this

          You were represented, in last night's conversation, as one who
          maintained the most extravagant opinion that ever entered into the
          mind of man, to wit, that there is no such thing as <em class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          That there is no such thing as what <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">philosophers</span></em> call <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          substance</span></em>, I am seriously persuaded: but, if I were
          made to see anything absurd or sceptical in this, I should then
          have the same reason to renounce this that I imagine I have now to
          reject the contrary opinion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          What! can anything be more fantastical, more repugnant to Common
          Sense, or a more manifest piece of Scepticism, than to believe
          there is no such thing as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Softly, good Hylas. What if it should prove that you, who hold
          there is, are, by virtue of that opinion, a greater sceptic, and
          maintain more paradoxes and repugnances to Common Sense, than I who
          believe no such thing?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          You may as soon persuade me, the part is greater than the whole, as
          that, in order to avoid absurdity and Scepticism, I should ever be
          obliged to give up my opinion in this point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Well then, are you content to admit that opinion for true, which
          upon examination shall appear most agreeable to Common Sense, and
          remote from Scepticism?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          With all my heart. Since you are for raising disputes about the
          plainest things in nature, I am content for once to hear what you
          have to say.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Pray, Hylas, what do you mean by a <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          He then who entertains no doubt concerning some particular point,
          with regard to that point cannot be thought a sceptic.</p>

          Whether doth doubting consist in embracing the affirmative or

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> In

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          He then that denies any point, can no more be said to doubt of it,
          than he who affirmeth it with the same degree of assurance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          And, consequently, for such his denial is no more to be esteemed a

          How cometh it to pass then, Hylas, that you pronounce me a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sceptic</span></em>, because I deny what you
          affirm, to wit, the existence of Matter? Since, for aught you can
          tell, I am as peremptory in my denial, as you in your
          affirmation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Hold, Philonous, I have been a little out in my definition; but
          every false step a man makes in discourse is not to be insisted on.
          I said indeed that a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sceptic</span></em> was one who doubted of
          everything; but I should have added, or who denies the reality and
          truth of things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What things? Do you mean the principles and theorems of sciences?
          But these you know are universal intellectual notions, and
          consequently independent of Matter. The denial therefore of this
          doth not imply the denying them<a id="noteref_788" name=
          "noteref_788" href="#note_788"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          grant it. But are there no other things? What think you of
          distrusting the senses, of denying the real existence of sensible
          things, or pretending to know nothing of them. Is not this
          sufficient to denominate a man a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sceptic</span></em>?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Shall we therefore examine which of us it is that denies the
          reality of sensible things, or professes the greatest ignorance of
          them; since, if I take you rightly, he is to be esteemed the
          greatest <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sceptic</span></em>?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That is what I desire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What mean you by Sensible Things?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Those things which are perceived by the senses. Can you imagine
          that I mean anything else?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Pardon me, Hylas, if I am desirous clearly to apprehend your
          notions, since this may much shorten our inquiry. Suffer me then to
          ask you this farther question. Are those things only perceived by
          the senses which are perceived immediately? Or, may those things
          properly be said to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensible</span></em> which are perceived
          mediately, or not without the intervention of others?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          do not sufficiently understand you.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          In reading a book, what I immediately perceive <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> are the letters; but mediately, or by
          means of these, are suggested to my mind the notions of God,
          virtue, truth, &amp;c. Now, that the letters are truly sensible
          things, or perceived by sense, there is no doubt: but I would know
          whether you take the things suggested by them to be so too.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          No, certainly: it were absurd to think <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God</span></em> or
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">virtue</span></em> sensible things; though
          they may be signified and suggested to the mind by sensible marks,
          with which they have an arbitrary connexion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It seems then, that by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensible things</span></em> you mean those
          only which can be perceived <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">immediately</span></em> by sense?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Right.</p>

          Doth it not follow from this, that though I see one part of the sky
          red, and another blue, and that my reason doth thence evidently
          conclude there must be some cause of that diversity of colours, yet
          that cause cannot be said to be a sensible thing, or perceived by
          the sense of seeing?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          doth.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          In like manner, though I hear variety of sounds, yet I cannot be
          said to hear the causes of those sounds?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          You cannot.</p>

          And when by my touch I perceive a thing to be hot and heavy, I
          cannot say, with any truth or propriety, that I feel the cause of
          its heat or weight?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> To
          prevent any more questions of this kind, I tell you once for all,
          that by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          which are perceived by sense; and that in truth the senses perceive
          nothing which they do not perceive <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">immediately</span></em>: for they make no
          inferences. The deducing therefore of causes or occasions from
          effects and appearances, which alone are perceived by sense,
          entirely relates to reason<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789"
          href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          This point then is agreed between us—That <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensible things are
          those only which are immediately perceived by sense</span></em>.
          You will farther inform me, whether we immediately perceive by

          by hearing, anything but sounds; by the palate, anything beside
          tastes; by the smell, beside odours; or by the touch, more than
          tangible qualities.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg

          Tell me, Hylas, is this real existence equally compatible to all
          degrees of heat, which we perceive; or is there any reason why we
          should attribute it to some, and deny it to others? And if there
          be, pray let me know that reason.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Whatever degree of heat we perceive by sense, we may be sure the
          same exists in the object that occasions it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          tell you, the reason is plainly the same in respect of both. They
          are both perceived by sense; nay, the greater degree of heat is
          more sensibly perceived; and consequently, if there is any
          difference, we are more certain of its real existence than we can

          Hold, Philonous, I fear I was out in yielding intense heat to be a

          Upon putting your hand near the fire, do you perceive one simple

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is not the heat immediately perceived?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And the pain?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>

          Seeing therefore they are both immediately perceived at the same
          time, and the fire affects you only with one simple or uncompounded
          idea, it follows that this same simple idea is both the intense
          heat immediately perceived, and the pain; and, consequently, that
          the intense heat immediately perceived is nothing distinct from a
          particular sort of pain.</p>

          Or can you frame to yourself an idea of sensible pain or pleasure
          in general, abstracted from every particular idea of heat, cold,
          tastes, smells? &amp;c.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Doth it not therefore follow, that sensible pain is nothing
          distinct from those sensations or ideas, in an intense degree?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is undeniable; and, to speak the truth, I begin to suspect a very
          great heat cannot exist but in a mind perceiving it.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          think I may be positive in the point. A very violent and painful
          heat cannot exist without the mind.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It hath not therefore, according to you, any <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
          being?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is it therefore certain, that there is no body in nature really
          hot?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          have not denied there is any real heat in bodies. I only say, there
          is no such thing as an intense real heat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, did you not say before that all degrees of heat were equally
          real; or, if there was any difference, that the greater were more
          undoubtedly real than the lesser?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          True: but it was because I did not then consider the ground there
          is for distinguishing between them, which I now plainly see. And it
          is this: because intense heat is nothing else but a particular kind
          of painful sensation; and pain cannot exist but in a perceiving
          being; it follows that no intense heat can really exist in an
          unperceiving corporeal substance. But this is no reason why we
          should deny heat in an inferior degree to exist in such a
          substance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But how shall we be able to discern those degrees of heat which
          exist only in the mind from those which exist without it?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That is no difficult matter. You know the least pain cannot exist
          unperceived; whatever, therefore, degree of heat is a pain exists
          only in the mind. But, as for all other degrees of heat, nothing
          obliges us to think the same of them.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

          And is not warmth, or a more gentle degree of heat than what causes
          uneasiness, a pleasure?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          What then?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Consequently, it cannot exist without the mind in an unperceiving
          substance, or body.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> So

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Since, therefore, as well those degrees of heat that are not
          painful, as those that are, can exist only in a thinking substance;
          may we not conclude that external bodies are absolutely incapable
          of any degree of heat whatsoever?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> On
          second thoughts, I do not think it so evident that warmth is a
          pleasure as that a great degree of heat is a pain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          do not pretend that warmth is as great a pleasure as heat is a
          pain. But, if you grant it to be even a small pleasure, it serves
          to make good my conclusion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          could rather call it an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">indolence</span></em>! It seems to be nothing
          more than a privation of both pain and pleasure. And that such a
          quality or state as this may agree to an unthinking substance, I
          hope you will not deny.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          If you are resolved to maintain that warmth, or a gentle degree of
          heat, is no pleasure, I know not how to convince you otherwise than
          by appealing to your own sense. But what think you of cold?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          The same that I do of heat. An intense degree of cold is a pain;
          for to feel a very great cold, is to perceive a great uneasiness:
          it cannot therefore exist without the mind; but a lesser degree of
          cold may, as well as a lesser degree of heat.</p>

          Those bodies, therefore, upon whose application to our own, we
          perceive a moderate degree of heat, must be concluded to have a
          moderate degree of heat or warmth in them; and those, upon whose
          application we feel a like degree of cold, must be thought to have
          cold in them.</p>

          Suppose now one of your hands hot, and the other cold, and that
          they are both at once put into the same vessel of water, in an
          intermediate state; will not the water seem cold to one hand, and
          warm to the other<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href=

          Ought we not therefore, by your principles, to conclude it is
          really both cold and warm at the same time, that is, according to
          your own concession, to believe an absurdity?</p>

          Consequently, the principles themselves are false, since you have

          Since, therefore, you neither judge the sensation itself occasioned
          by the pin, nor anything like it to be in the pin; you should not,
          conformably to what you have now granted, judge the sensation
          occasioned by the fire, or anything like it, to be in the fire.</p>

          Well, since it must be so, I am content to yield this point, and
          acknowledge that heat and cold are only sensations existing in our
          minds. But there still remain qualities enough to secure the
          reality of external things.</p>

          But what will you say, Hylas, if it shall appear that the case is

          Let us examine them in order. What think you of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tastes</span></em>—do they exist without the
          mind, or no?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Can any man in his senses doubt whether sugar is sweet, or wormwood
          bitter?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Inform me, Hylas. Is a sweet taste a particular kind of pleasure or
          pleasant sensation, or is it not?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And is not bitterness some kind of uneasiness or pain?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          grant it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          If therefore sugar and wormwood are unthinking corporeal substances
          existing without the mind, how can sweetness and bitterness, that
          is, pleasure and pain, agree to them?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Hold, Philonous, I now see what it was deluded me all this time.
          You asked whether heat and cold, sweetness and bitterness, were not
          particular sorts of pleasure and pain; to which I answered simply,
          that they were. Whereas I should have thus distinguished:—those
          qualities, as perceived by us, are pleasures or pains; but not as
          existing in the external objects. We must not therefore conclude
          absolutely, that there is no heat in the fire, or sweetness in the
          sugar, but only that heat or sweetness, as perceived by us, are not
          in the fire or sugar. What say you to this?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          say it is nothing to the purpose. Our discourse proceeded
          altogether concerning sensible things, which you defined to be,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          things we immediately perceive by our senses</span></em>. Whatever
          other qualities, therefore, you speak of, as distinct from these, I
          know nothing of them, neither do they at all belong to the point in
          dispute. You may, indeed, pretend to have discovered certain
          qualities which you do not perceive, and assert those insensible
          qualities exist in fire and sugar. But what use can be made of this
          to your present purpose, I am at a loss to conceive. Tell me then
          once more, do you acknowledge that heat and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cold, sweetness and bitterness (meaning
          those qualities which are perceived by the senses), do not exist
          without the mind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          see it is to no purpose to hold out, so I give up the cause as to
          those mentioned qualities. Though I profess it sounds oddly, to say
          that sugar is not sweet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, for your farther satisfaction, take this along with you: that
          which at other times seems sweet, shall, to a distempered palate,
          appear bitter. And, nothing can be plainer than that divers persons
          perceive different tastes in the same food; since that which one
          man delights in, another abhors. And how could this be, if the
          taste was something really inherent in the food?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          acknowledge I know not how.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          In the next place, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">odours</span></em> are to be considered. And,
          with regard to these, I would fain know whether what hath been said
          of tastes doth not exactly agree to them? Are they not so many
          pleasing or displeasing sensations?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          They are.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Can you then conceive it possible that they should exist in an
          unperceiving thing?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          cannot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Or, can you imagine that filth and ordure affect those brute
          animals that feed on them out of choice, with the same smells which
          we perceive in them?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> By
          no means.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          May we not therefore conclude of smells, as of the other
          forementioned qualities, that they cannot exist in any but a
          perceiving substance or mind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          think so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Then as to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sounds</span></em>, what must we think of
          them: are they accidents really inherent in external bodies, or
          not?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That they inhere not in the sonorous bodies is plain from hence:
          because a bell struck in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump
          sends forth no sound. The air, therefore, must be thought the
          subject of sound.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What reason is there for that, Hylas?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Because, when any motion is raised in the air, we perceive a sound
          greater or lesser, according to the air's motion; but without some
          motion in the air, we never hear any sound at all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And granting that we never hear a sound but when <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> some motion is produced in the air, yet
          I do not see how you can infer from thence, that the sound itself
          is in the air.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is this very motion in the external air that produces in the mind
          the sensation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sound</span></em>. For, striking on the drum
          of the ear, it causeth a vibration, which by the auditory nerves
          being communicated to the brain, the soul is thereupon affected
          with the sensation called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sound</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What! is sound then a sensation?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          tell you, as perceived by us, it is a particular sensation in the
          mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And can any sensation exist without the mind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          No, certainly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How then can sound, being a sensation, exist in the air, if by the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">air</span></em> you mean a senseless substance
          existing without the mind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          You must distinguish, Philonous, between sound as it is perceived
          by us, and as it is in itself; or (which is the same thing) between
          the sound we immediately perceive, and that which exists without
          us. The former, indeed, is a particular kind of sensation, but the
          latter is merely a vibrative or undulatory motion in the air.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          thought I had already obviated that distinction, by the answer I
          gave when you were applying it in a like case before. But, to say
          no more of that, are you sure then that sound is really nothing but
          motion?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I

          Whatever therefore agrees to real sound, may with truth be
          attributed to motion?</p>

          It is then good sense to speak of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motion</span></em>
          as of a thing that is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          see you are resolved not to understand me. Is it not evident those
          accidents or modes belong only to sensible sound, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sound</span></em>
          in the common acceptation of the word, but not to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sound</span></em>
          in the real and philosophic sense; which, as I just now told you,
          is nothing but a certain motion of the air?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It seems then there are two sorts of sound—the one vulgar, or that
          which is heard, the other philosophical and real?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Even so.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And the latter consists in motion?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Tell me, Hylas, to which of the senses, think you, the idea of
          motion belongs? to the hearing?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>

          It should follow then, that, according to you, real sounds may
          possibly be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">seen</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em>,
          but never <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          Look you, Philonous, you may, if you please, make a jest of my
          opinion, but that will not alter the truth of things. I own,
          indeed, the inferences you draw me into sound something oddly; but
          common language, you know, is framed by, and for the use of the
          vulgar: we must not therefore wonder if expressions adapted to
          exact philosophic notions seem uncouth and out of the way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is it come to that? I assure you, I imagine myself to have gained
          no small point, since you make so light of departing from common
          phrases and opinions; it being a main part of our inquiry, to
          examine whose notions are widest of the common road, and most
          repugnant to the general sense of the world. But, can you think it
          no more than a philosophical paradox, to say that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real sounds are
          never heard</span></em>, and that the idea of them is obtained by
          some other sense? And is there nothing in this contrary to nature
          and the truth of things?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> To
          deal ingenuously, I do not like it. And, after the concessions
          already made, I had as well grant that sounds too have no real
          being without the mind.</p>

          And I hope you will make no difficulty to acknowledge the same of

          Pardon me: the case of colours is very different. Can anything be

          Have patience, good Hylas; and tell me once more, whether there is
          anything immediately perceived by the senses, except sensible
          qualities. I know you asserted there was not; but I would now be
          informed, whether you still persist in the same opinion.</p>

          do.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Pray, is your corporeal substance either a sensible quality, or
          made up of sensible qualities?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          What a question that is! who ever thought it was?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          My reason for asking was, because in saying, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">each visible object
          hath that colour which we see in it</span></em>, you make visible
          objects to be corporeal substances; which implies either that
          corporeal substances are sensible qualities, or else that there is
          something beside sensible qualities perceived by sight: but, as
          this point was formerly agreed between us, and is still maintained
          by you, it is a clear consequence, that your <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corporeal
          substance</span></em> is nothing distinct from <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensible

          You may draw as many absurd consequences as you please, and
          endeavour to perplex the plainest things; but you shall never
          persuade me out of my senses. I clearly understand my own
          meaning.</p>

          wish you would make me understand it too. But, since you are
          unwilling to have your notion of corporeal substance examined, I
          shall urge that point no farther. Only be pleased to let me know,
          whether the same colours which we see exist in external bodies, or
          some other.</p>

          What! are then the beautiful red and purple we see on yonder clouds
          really in them? Or do you imagine they have in themselves any other
          form than that of a dark mist or vapour?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          must own, Philonous, those colours are not really in the clouds as
          they seem to be at this distance. They are only apparent
          colours.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          Very easily. Those are to be thought apparent which, appearing only
          at a distance, vanish upon a nearer approach.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And those, I suppose, are to be thought real which are discovered
          by the most near and exact survey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Right.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is the nearest and exactest survey made by the help of a
          microscope, or by the naked eye?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> By
          a microscope, doubtless.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But a microscope often discovers colours in an object different
          from those perceived by the unassisted sight. And, in case we had
          microscopes magnifying to any assigned degree, it is certain that
          no object whatsoever, viewed through them, would appear in the same
          colour which it exhibits to the naked eye.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          And what will you conclude from all this? You cannot argue that
          there are really and naturally no colours on objects: because by
          artificial managements they may be altered, or made to vanish.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          think it may evidently be concluded from your own concessions, that
          all the colours we see with our naked eyes are only apparent as
          those on the clouds, since they vanish upon a more close and
          accurate inspection which is afforded us by a microscope. Then, as
          to what you say by way of prevention: I ask you whether the real
          and natural state of an object is better discovered by a very sharp
          and piercing sight, or by one which is less sharp?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> By
          the former without doubt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is it not plain from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dioptrics</span></span> that microscopes make
          the sight more penetrating, and represent objects as they would
          appear to the eye in case it were naturally endowed with a most
          exquisite sharpness?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Consequently the microscopical representation is to be thought that
          which best sets forth the real nature of the thing, or what it is
          in itself. The colours, therefore, by it perceived are more genuine
          and real than those perceived otherwise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          confess there is something in what you say.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Besides, it is not only possible but manifest, that there actually
          are animals whose eyes are by nature framed <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to perceive those things which by
          reason of their minuteness escape our sight. What think you of
          those inconceivably small animals perceived by glasses? Must we
          suppose they are all stark blind? Or, in case they see, can it be
          imagined their sight hath not the same use in preserving their
          bodies from injuries, which appears in that of all other animals?
          And if it hath, is it not evident they must see particles less than
          their own bodies; which will present them with a far different view
          in each object from that which strikes our senses<a id=
          "noteref_795" name="noteref_795" href="#note_795"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">795</span></span></a>? Even
          our own eyes do not always represent objects to us after the same
          manner. In the jaundice every one knows that all things seem
          yellow. Is it not therefore highly probable those animals in whose
          eyes we discern a very different texture from that of ours, and
          whose bodies abound with different humours, do not see the same
          colours in every object that we do? From all which, should it not
          seem to follow that all colours are equally apparent, and that none
          of those which we perceive are really inherent in any outward
          object?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          should.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          The point will be past all doubt, if you consider that, in case
          colours were real properties or affections inherent in external
          bodies, they could admit of no alteration without some change
          wrought in the very bodies themselves: but, is it not evident from
          what hath been said that, upon the use of microscopes, upon a
          change happening in the humours of the eye, or a variation of
          distance, without any manner of real alteration in the thing
          itself, the colours of any object are either changed, or totally
          disappear? Nay, all other circumstances remaining the same, change
          but the situation of some objects, and they shall present different
          colours to the eye. The same thing happens upon viewing an object
          in various degrees of light. And what is more known than that the
          same bodies appear differently coloured by candle-light from what
          they do in the open day? Add to these the experiment of a prism
          which, separating the heterogeneous rays of light, alters the
          colour of any object, and will cause the whitest to appear of a
          deep blue or red to the naked eye. And now tell me whether you are
          still of opinion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg

          that every body hath its true real colour inhering in it; and, if
          you think it hath, I would fain know farther from you, what certain
          distance and position of the object, what peculiar texture and
          formation of the eye, what degree or kind of light is necessary for
          ascertaining that true colour, and distinguishing it from apparent
          ones.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          own myself entirely satisfied, that they are all equally apparent,
          and that there is no such thing as colour really inhering in
          external bodies, but that it is altogether in the light. And what
          confirms me in this opinion is, that in proportion to the light
          colours are still more or less vivid; and if there be no light,
          then are there no colours perceived. Besides, allowing there are
          colours on external objects, yet, how is it possible for us to
          perceive them? For no external body affects the mind, unless it
          acts first on our organs of sense. But the only action of bodies is
          motion; and motion cannot be communicated otherwise than by
          impulse. A distant object therefore cannot act on the eye; nor
          consequently make itself or its properties perceivable to the soul.
          Whence it plainly follows that it is immediately some contiguous
          substance, which, operating on the eye, occasions a perception of
          colours: and such is light.</p>

          How! is light then a substance?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          tell you, Philonous, external light is nothing but a thin fluid
          substance, whose minute particles being agitated with a brisk
          motion, and in various manners reflected from the different
          surfaces of outward objects to the eyes, communicate different
          motions to the optic nerves; which, being propagated to the brain,
          cause therein various impressions; and these are attended with the
          sensations of red, blue, yellow, &amp;c.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It seems then the light doth no more than shake the optic
          nerves.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And consequent to each particular motion of the nerves, the mind is
          affected with a sensation, which is some particular colour.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          How then do you affirm that colours are in the light; since by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">light</span></em> you understand a corporeal
          substance external to the mind?</p>

          Light and colours, as immediately perceived by us, I grant cannot
          exist without the mind. But in themselves they are only the motions
          and configurations of certain insensible particles of matter.</p>

          Colours then, in the vulgar sense, or taken for the immediate
          objects of sight, cannot agree to any but a perceiving
          substance.</p>

          Well then, since you give up the point as to those sensible
          qualities which are alone thought colours by all mankind beside,
          you may hold what you please with regard to those invisible ones of
          the philosophers. It is not my business to dispute about <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>;
          only I would advise you to bethink yourself, whether, considering
          the inquiry we are upon, it be prudent for you to affirm—<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the red and blue
          which we see are not real colours, but certain unknown motions and
          figures which no man ever did or can see are truly so</span></em>.
          Are not these shocking notions, and are not they subject to as many
          ridiculous inferences, as those you were obliged to renounce before
          in the case of sounds?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          frankly own, Philonous, that it is in vain to stand out any longer.
          Colours, sounds, tastes, in a word all those termed <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">secondary
          qualities</span></em>, have certainly no existence without the
          mind. But by this acknowledgment I must not be supposed to derogate
          anything from the reality of Matter, or external objects; seeing it
          is no more than several philosophers maintain<a id="noteref_796"
          name="noteref_796" href="#note_796"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a>, who
          nevertheless are the farthest imaginable from denying Matter. For
          the clearer understanding of this, you must know sensible qualities
          are by philosophers divided into <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Primary</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Secondary</span></em><a id="noteref_797" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">797</span></span></a>. The
          former are Extension, Figure, Solidity, Gravity, Motion, and Rest;
          and these they hold exist really in Bodies. The latter are those
          above enumerated; or, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg
          398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          briefly, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">all sensible qualities beside the
          Primary</span></em>; which they assert are only so many sensations
          or ideas existing nowhere but in the mind. But all this, I doubt
          not, you are apprised of. For my part, I have been a long time
          sensible there was such an opinion current among philosophers, but
          was never thoroughly convinced of its truth until now.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          You are still then of opinion that <em class=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">figures</span></em>
          are inherent in external unthinking substances?</p>

          Answer me, Hylas. Think you the senses were bestowed upon all
          animals for their preservation and well-being in life? or were they
          given to men alone for this end?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          If so, is it not necessary they should be enabled by them to

          Can one and the same thing be at the same time in itself of

          But, from what you have laid down it follows that both the
          extension by you perceived, and that perceived by the mite itself,
          as likewise all those perceived by lesser animals, are each of them
          the true extension of the mite's foot; that is to say, by your own
          principles you are led into an absurdity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          There seems to be some difficulty in the point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Again, have you not acknowledged that no real inherent property of
          any object can be changed without some change in the thing
          itself?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, as we approach to or recede from an object, the visible
          extension varies, being at one distance ten or a hundred times
          greater than at another. Doth it not therefore follow from hence
          likewise that it is not really inherent in the object?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Your judgment will soon be determined, if you will venture to think
          as freely concerning this quality as you have done concerning the
          rest. Was it not admitted as a good argument, that neither heat nor
          cold was in the water, because it seemed warm to one hand and cold
          to the other?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It

          Is it not the very same reasoning to conclude, there is no
          extension or figure in an object, because to one eye it shall seem
          little, smooth, and round, when at the same time it appears to the
          other, great, uneven, and angular?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          The very same. But does this latter fact ever happen?</p>

          consequences following upon such a concession.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Odd, say you? After the concessions already made, I hope you will
          stick at nothing for its oddness. [<a id="noteref_799" name=

          on the other hand, should it not seem very odd, if the general
          reasoning which includes all other sensible qualities did not also
          include extension? If it be allowed that no idea, nor anything like
          an idea, can exist in an unperceiving substance, then surely it
          follows that no figure, or mode of extension, which we can either
          perceive, or imagine, or have any idea of, can be really inherent
          in Matter; not to mention the peculiar difficulty there must be in
          conceiving a material substance, prior to and distinct from
          extension, to be the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          That is a right you cannot be denied. Figures and extension being
          despatched, we proceed next to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">motion</span></em>.
          Can a real motion in any external body be at the same time both
          very swift and very slow?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          cannot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is not the motion of a body swift in a reciprocal proportion to the
          time it takes up in describing any given space? Thus a body that
          describes a mile in an hour moves three times faster than it would
          in case it described only a mile in three hours.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          agree with you.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And is not time measured by the succession of ideas in our
          minds?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And is it not possible ideas should succeed one another twice as
          fast in your mind as they do in mine, or in that of some spirit of
          another kind?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg
          401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Consequently the same body may to another seem to perform its
          motion over any space in half the time that it doth to you. And the
          same reasoning will hold as to any other proportion: that is to
          say, according to your principles (since the motions perceived are
          both really in the object) it is possible one and the same body
          shall be really moved the same way at once, both very swift and
          very slow. How is this consistent either with common sense, or with
          what you just now granted?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          have nothing to say to it.</p>

          Then as for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">solidity</span></em>; either you do not mean
          any sensible quality by that word, and so it is beside our inquiry:
          or if you do, it must be either hardness or resistance. But both
          the one and the other are plainly relative to our senses: it being
          evident that what seems hard to one animal may appear soft to
          another, who hath greater force and firmness of limbs. Nor is it
          less plain that the resistance I feel is not in the body.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          own the very <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensation</span></em> of resistance, which is
          all you immediately perceive, is not in the body; but the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cause</span></em> of that sensation is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But the causes of our sensations are not things immediately
          perceived, and therefore are not sensible. This point I thought had
          been already determined.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          own it was; but you will pardon me if I seem a little embarrassed:
          I know not how to quit my old notions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          To help you out, do but consider that if <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">extension</span></em> be once acknowledged to
          have no existence without the mind, the same must necessarily be
          granted of motion, solidity, and gravity; since they all evidently
          suppose extension. It is therefore superfluous to inquire
          particularly concerning each of them. In denying extension, you
          have denied them all to have any real existence<a id="noteref_800"
          name="noteref_800" href="#note_800"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          wonder, Philonous, if what you say be true, why those philosophers
          who deny the Secondary Qualities any real existence should yet
          attribute it to the Primary. If there is no difference between
          them, how can this be accounted for?</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It is not my business to account for every opinion of the
          philosophers. But, among other reasons which may be assigned for
          this, it seems probable that pleasure and pain being rather annexed
          to the former than the latter may be one. Heat and cold, tastes and
          smells, have something more vividly pleasing or disagreeable than
          the ideas of extension, figure, and motion affect us with. And, it
          being too visibly absurd to hold that pain or pleasure can be in an
          unperceiving Substance, men are more easily weaned from believing
          the external existence of the Secondary than the Primary Qualities.
          You will be satisfied there is something in this, if you recollect
          the difference you made between an intense and more moderate degree
          of heat; allowing the one a real existence, while you denied it to
          the other. But, after all, there is no rational ground for that
          distinction; for, surely an indifferent sensation is as truly
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          sensation</span></em> as one more pleasing or painful; and
          consequently should not any more than they be supposed to exist in
          an unthinking subject.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is just come into my head, Philonous, that I have somewhere heard
          of a distinction between absolute and sensible extension<a id=
          "noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a>. Now,
          though it be acknowledged that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">small</span></em>, consisting merely in the
          relation which other extended beings have to the parts of our own
          bodies, do not really inhere in the substances themselves; yet
          nothing obliges us to hold the same with regard to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute
          extension</span></em>, which is something abstracted from
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">great</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">small</span></em>,
          from this or that particular magnitude or figure. So likewise as to
          motion; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">swift</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">slow</span></em>
          are altogether relative to the succession of ideas in our own
          minds. But, it doth not follow, because those modifications of
          motion exist not without the mind, that therefore absolute motion
          abstracted from them doth not.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Pray what is it that distinguishes one motion, or one part of
          extension, from another? Is it not something sensible, as some
          degree of swiftness or slowness, some certain magnitude or figure
          peculiar to each?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg
          403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          These qualities, therefore, stripped of all sensible properties,
          are without all specific and numerical differences, as the schools
          call them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          They are.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          That is to say, they are extension in general, and motion in
          general.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Let it be so.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But it is a universally received maxim that <em class=

          corporeal substance?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          But I think the point may be speedily decided. Without doubt you
          can tell whether you are able to frame this or that idea. Now I am
          content to put our dispute on this issue. If you can frame in your
          thoughts a distinct <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstract idea</span></em> of motion or
          extension, divested of all those sensible modes, as swift and slow,
          great and small, round and square, and the like, which are
          acknowledged to exist only in the mind, I will then yield the point
          you contend for. But if you cannot, it will be unreasonable on your
          side to insist any longer upon what you have no notion<a id=
          "noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class=

          of.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> To
          confess ingenuously, I cannot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Can you even separate the ideas of extension and motion from the
          ideas of all those qualities which they who make the distinction
          term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">secondary</span></em>?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          What! is it not an easy matter to consider extension and motion by
          themselves, abstracted from all other sensible qualities? Pray how
          do the mathematicians treat of them?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          acknowledge, Hylas, it is not difficult to form general
          propositions and reasonings about those qualities, without
          mentioning any other; and, in this sense, to consider or treat of
          them abstractedly<a id="noteref_804" name="noteref_804" href=
          "#note_804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">804</span></span></a>. But,
          how doth it follow that, because I can pronounce the word
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">motion</span></em> by itself, I can form the
          idea of it in my mind exclusive <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of body? or, because theorems may be made of
          extension and figures, without any mention of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></em>
          or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">small</span></em>, or any other sensible mode
          or quality, that therefore it is possible such an abstract idea of
          extension, without any particular size or figure, or sensible
          quality<a id="noteref_805" name="noteref_805" href=
          "#note_805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">805</span></span></a>,
          should be distinctly formed, and apprehended by the mind?
          Mathematicians treat of quantity, without regarding what other
          sensible qualities it is attended with, as being altogether
          indifferent to their demonstrations. But, when laying aside the
          words, they contemplate the bare ideas, I believe you will find,
          they are not the pure abstracted ideas of extension.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          But what say you to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pure intellect</span></em>? May not abstracted
          ideas be framed by that faculty?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Since I cannot frame abstract ideas at all, it is plain I cannot
          frame them by the help of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pure intellect</span></em>; whatsoever faculty
          you understand by those words<a id="noteref_806" name="noteref_806"
          href="#note_806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">806</span></span></a>.
          Besides, not to inquire into the nature of pure intellect and its
          spiritual objects, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">virtue</span></em>, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reason</span></em>,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">God</span></em>, or the like, thus much seems
          manifest—that sensible things are only to be perceived by sense, or
          represented by the imagination. Figures, therefore, and extension,
          being originally perceived by sense, do not belong to pure
          intellect: but, for your farther satisfaction, try if you can frame
          the idea of any figure, abstracted from all particularities of
          size, or even from other sensible qualities.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>Let
          me think a little——I do not find that I can.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And can you think it possible that should really exist in nature
          which implies a repugnancy in its conception?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Since therefore it is impossible even for the mind to disunite the
          ideas of extension and motion from all other sensible qualities,
          doth it not follow, that where the one exist there necessarily the
          other exist likewise?</p>

          Consequently, the very same arguments which you admitted as
          conclusive against the Secondary Qualities are, without any farther
          application of force, against the Primary too. Besides, if you will
          trust your senses, is it not plain all sensible qualities coexist,
          or to them appear as being in the same place? Do they ever
          represent a motion, or figure, as being divested of all other
          visible and tangible qualities?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          You need say no more on this head. I am free to own, if there be no
          secret error or oversight in our proceedings hitherto, that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">all</span></em> sensible qualities are alike
          to be denied existence without the mind<a id="noteref_807" name=
          "noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a>. But,
          my fear is that I have been too liberal in my former concessions,
          or overlooked some fallacy or other. In short, I did not take time
          to think.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          For that matter, Hylas, you may take what time you please in
          reviewing the progress of our inquiry. You are at liberty to
          recover any slips you might have made, or offer whatever you have
          omitted which makes for your first opinion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          One great oversight I take to be this—that I did not sufficiently
          distinguish the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">object</span></em> from the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">808</span></span></a>. Now,
          though this latter may not exist without the mind, yet it will not
          thence follow that the former cannot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What object do you mean? the object of the senses?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          The same.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It is then immediately perceived?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Right.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Make me to understand the difference between what is immediately
          perceived and a sensation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          The sensation I take to be an act of the mind perceiving; besides
          which, there is something perceived; and this I call the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em>.
          For example, there is red and yellow on that tulip. But then the
          act of perceiving those colours is in me only, and not in the
          tulip.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What tulip do you speak of? Is it that which you see?</p>

          And what do you see beside colour, figure, and extension<a id=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Nothing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What you would say then is that the red and yellow are coexistent
          with the extension; is it not?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That is not all; I would say they have a real existence without the
          mind, in some unthinking substance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          That the colours are really in the tulip which I see is manifest.
          Neither can it be denied that this tulip may exist independent of
          your mind or mine; but, that any immediate object of the
          senses—that is, any idea, or combination of ideas—should exist in
          an unthinking substance, or exterior to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
          minds, is in itself an evident contradiction. Nor can I imagine how
          this follows from what you said just now, to wit, that the red and
          yellow were on the tulip <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">you saw</span></em>, since you do not pretend
          to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">see</span></em> that unthinking substance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          You have an artful way, Philonous, of diverting our inquiry from
          the subject.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          see you have no mind to be pressed that way. To return then to your
          distinction between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensation</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">object</span></em>;
          if I take you right, you distinguish in every perception two
          things, the one an action of the mind, the other not.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          True.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And this action cannot exist in, or belong to, any unthinking
          thing<a id="noteref_810" name="noteref_810" href=
          "#note_810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a>; but,
          whatever beside is implied in a perception may?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That is my meaning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          So that if there was a perception without any act of the mind, it
          were possible such a perception should exist in an unthinking
          substance?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          grant it. But it is impossible there should be such a
          perception.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          When is the mind said to be active?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          When it produces, puts an end to, or changes, anything.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Can the mind produce, discontinue, or change anything, but by an
          act of the will?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          cannot.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          The mind therefore is to be accounted <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em>
          in its perceptions so far forth as <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">volition</span></em> is included in them?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          In plucking this flower I am active; because I do it by the motion
          of my hand, which was consequent upon my volition; so likewise in
          applying it to my nose. But is either of these smelling?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          No.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          act too in drawing the air through my nose; because my breathing so
          rather than otherwise is the effect of my volition. But neither can
          this be called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">smelling</span></em>: for, if it were, I
          should smell every time I breathed in that manner?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          True.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Smelling then is somewhat consequent to all this?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But I do not find my will concerned any farther. Whatever more
          there is—as that I perceive such a particular smell, or any smell
          at all—this is independent of my will, and therein I am altogether
          passive. Do you find it otherwise with you, Hylas?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          No, the very same.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Then, as to seeing, is it not in your power to open your eyes, or
          keep them shut; to turn them this or that way?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Without doubt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, doth it in like manner depend on <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">your</span></em>
          will that in looking on this flower you perceive <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">white</span></em>
          rather than any other colour? Or, directing your open eyes towards
          yonder part of the heaven, can you avoid seeing the sun? Or is
          light or darkness the effect of your volition?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          No, certainly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          You are then in these respects altogether passive?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          am.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Tell me now, whether <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">seeing</span></em> consists in perceiving
          light and colours, or in opening and turning the eyes?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Without doubt, in the former.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Since therefore you are in the very perception of light and colours
          altogether passive, what is become of that action you were speaking
          of as an ingredient in every sensation? And, doth it not follow
          from your own concessions, that the perception of light and
          colours, including no action in it, may exist in an unperceiving
          substance? And is not this a plain contradiction?</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408"

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          know not what to think of it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Besides, since you distinguish the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">passive</span></em> in every perception, you
          must do it in that of pain. But how is it possible that pain, be it
          as little active as you please, should exist in an unperceiving
          substance? In short, do but consider the point, and then confess
          ingenuously, whether light and colours, tastes, sounds, &amp;c. are
          not all equally passions or sensations in the soul. You may indeed
          call them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">external objects</span></em>, and give them in
          words what subsistence you please. But, examine your own thoughts,
          and then tell me whether it be not as I say?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          acknowledge, Philonous, that, upon a fair observation of what
          passes in my mind, I can discover nothing else but that I am a
          thinking being, affected with variety of sensations; neither is it
          possible to conceive how a sensation should exist in an
          unperceiving substance.—But then, on the other hand, when I look on
          sensible things in a different view, considering them as so many
          modes and qualities, I find it necessary to suppose a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          substratum</span></em>, without which they cannot be conceived to

          It is therefore somewhat in its own nature entirely distinct from

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I

          Answer me, Hylas. Can a thing be spread without extension? or is
          not the idea of extension necessarily included in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">spreading</span></em>?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Whatsoever therefore you suppose spread under anything must have in
          itself an extension distinct from the extension of that thing under
          which it is spread?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          must.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Consequently, every corporeal substance, being the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> of extension, must have
          in itself another extension, by which it is qualified to be a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em>: and so on to infinity?
          And I ask whether this be not absurd in itself, and repugnant to
          what you granted just now, to wit, that the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> was something distinct
          from and exclusive of extension?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Aye but, Philonous, you take me wrong. I do not mean that Matter is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">spread</span></em> in a gross literal sense
          under extension. The word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> is used only to express
          in general the same thing with <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Well then, let us examine the relation implied in the term
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substance</span></em>. Is it not that it
          stands under accidents?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          The very same.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, that one thing may stand under or support another, must it not
          be extended?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It

          Is not therefore this supposition liable to the same absurdity with
          the former?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg

          You still take things in a strict literal sense. That is not fair,
          Philonous.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          explain them as you please. Only, I beseech you, make me understand
          something by them. You tell me Matter supports or stands under
          accidents. How! is it as your legs support your body?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          No; that is the literal sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Pray let me know any sense, literal or not literal, that you
          understand it in.—How long must I wait for an answer, Hylas?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          declare I know not what to say. I once thought I understood well
          enough what was meant by Matter's supporting accidents. But now,
          the more I think on it the less can I comprehend it: in short I
          find that I know nothing of it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It seems then you have no idea at all, neither relative nor
          positive, of Matter; you know neither what it is in itself, nor
          what relation it bears to accidents?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          acknowledge it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And yet you asserted that you could not conceive how qualities or
          accidents should really exist, without conceiving at the same time
          a material support of them?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          did.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          That is to say, when you conceive the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
          existence of qualities, you do withal conceive Something which you
          cannot conceive?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          was wrong, I own. But still I fear there is some fallacy or other.
          Pray what think you of this? It is just come into my head that the
          ground of all our mistake lies in your treating of each quality by
          itself. Now, I grant that each quality cannot singly subsist
          without the mind. Colour cannot without extension, neither can
          figure without some other sensible quality. But, as the several
          qualities united or blended together form entire sensible things,
          nothing hinders why such things may not be supposed to exist
          without the mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Either, Hylas, you are jesting, or have a very bad memory. Though
          indeed we went through all the qualities by name one after another,
          yet my arguments, or rather your concessions, nowhere tended to
          prove that the Secondary Qualities did not subsist each alone by
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name=
          "Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> itself; but, that
          they were not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">at all</span></em> without the mind. Indeed,
          in treating of figure and motion we concluded they could not exist
          without the mind, because it was impossible even in thought to
          separate them from all secondary qualities, so as to conceive them
          existing by themselves. But then this was not the only argument
          made use of upon that occasion. But (to pass by all that hath been
          hitherto said, and reckon it for nothing, if you will have it so) I
          am content to put the whole upon this issue. If you can conceive it
          possible for any mixture or combination of qualities, or any
          sensible object whatever, to exist without the mind, then I will
          grant it actually to be so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> If
          it comes to that the point will soon be decided. What more easy
          than to conceive a tree or house existing by itself, independent
          of, and unperceived by, any mind whatsoever? I do at this present
          time conceive them existing after that manner.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How say you, Hylas, can you see a thing which is at the same time
          unseen?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          No, that were a contradiction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is it not as great a contradiction to talk of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">conceiving</span></em> a thing which is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It

          The tree or house therefore which you think of is conceived by

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And what is conceived is surely in the mind?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Without question, that which is conceived is in the mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How then came you to say, you conceived a house or tree existing
          independent and out of all minds whatsoever?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That was I own an oversight; but stay, let me consider what led me
          into it.—It is a pleasant mistake enough. As I was thinking of a
          tree in a solitary place, where no one was present to see it,
          methought that was to conceive a tree as existing unperceived or
          unthought of; not considering that I myself conceived it all the
          while. But now I plainly see that all I can do is to frame ideas in
          my own mind. I may indeed conceive in my own thoughts the idea of a
          tree, or a house, or a mountain, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that is all. And this is far from proving
          that I can conceive them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">existing out of the minds of all
          Spirits</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          You acknowledge then that you cannot possibly conceive how any one
          corporeal sensible thing should exist otherwise than in a mind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And yet you will earnestly contend for the truth of that which you
          cannot so much as conceive?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> By
          no means.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          You ought not therefore to conclude that sensible objects are
          without the mind, from their appearance, or manner wherein they are
          perceived.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          acknowledge it. But doth not my sense deceive me in those
          cases?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          By no means. The idea or thing which you immediately perceive,
          neither sense nor reason informs you that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em>
          actually exists without the mind. By sense you only know that you
          are affected with such certain sensations of light and colours,
          &amp;c. And these you will not say are without the mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          True: but, beside all that, do you not think the sight suggests
          something of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">outness</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">distance</span></em>?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Upon approaching a distant object, do the visible size and figure
          change perpetually, or do they appear the same at all
          distances?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          They are in a continual change.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Sight therefore doth not suggest, or any way inform you, that the
          visible object you immediately perceive <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> exists at a distance<a id="noteref_812" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">812</span></span></a>, or
          will be perceived when you advance farther onward; there being a
          continued series of visible objects succeeding each other during
          the whole time of your approach.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          doth not; but still I know, upon seeing an object, what object I
          shall perceive after having passed over a certain distance: no
          matter whether it be exactly the same or no: there is still
          something of distance suggested in the case.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Good Hylas, do but reflect a little on the point, and then tell me
          whether there be any more in it than this: From the ideas you
          actually perceive by sight, you have by experience learned to
          collect what other ideas you will (according to the standing order
          of nature) be affected with, after such a certain succession of
          time and motion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Upon the whole, I take it to be nothing else.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Now, is it not plain that if we suppose a man born blind was on a
          sudden made to see, he could at first have no experience of what
          may be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">suggested</span></em> by sight?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          He would not then, according to you, have any notion of distance
          annexed to the things he saw; but would take them for a new set of
          sensations, existing only in his mind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is undeniable.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, to make it still more plain: is not <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">distance</span></em> a line turned endwise to
          the eye<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href=
          "#note_813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And can a line so situated be perceived by sight?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Doth it not therefore follow that distance is not properly and
          immediately perceived by sight?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          should seem so.</p>

          Again, is it your opinion that colours are at a distance<a id=
          "noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href="#note_814"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          must be acknowledged they are only in the mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But do not colours appear to the eye as coexisting in the same
          place with extension and figures?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          They do.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How can you then conclude from sight that figures exist without,
          when you acknowledge colours do not; the sensible appearance being
          the very same with regard to both?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I

          But, allowing that distance was truly and immediately perceived by
          the mind, yet it would not thence follow it existed out of the
          mind. For, whatever is immediately perceived is an idea<a id=
          "noteref_815" name="noteref_815" href="#note_815"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a>: and
          can any idea exist out of the mind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> To
          suppose that were absurd: but, inform me, Philonous, can we
          perceive or know nothing beside our ideas<a id="noteref_816" name=
          "noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a>?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          As for the rational deducing of causes from effects, that is beside
          our inquiry. And, by the senses you can best tell whether you
          perceive anything which is not immediately perceived. And I ask
          you, whether the things immediately perceived are other than your
          own sensations or ideas? You have indeed more than once, in the
          course of this conversation, declared yourself on those points; but
          you seem, by this last question, to have departed from what you
          then thought.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> To
          speak the truth, Philonous, I think there are two kinds of
          objects:—the one perceived immediately, which are likewise called
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>; the other are real things
          or external objects, perceived by the mediation of ideas, which are
          their images and representations. Now, I own ideas do not exist
          without the mind; but the latter sort of objects do. I am sorry I
          did not think of this distinction sooner; it would probably have
          cut short your discourse.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Are those external objects perceived by sense, or by some other
          faculty?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          They are perceived by sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How! Is there anything perceived by sense which is not immediately
          perceived?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Yes, Philonous, in some sort there is. For example, when I look on
          a picture or statue of Julius Cæsar, I may <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> be said after a manner to perceive him
          (though not immediately) by my senses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It seems then you will have our ideas, which alone are immediately
          perceived, to be pictures of external things: and that these also
          are perceived by sense, inasmuch as they have a conformity or
          resemblance to our ideas?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That is my meaning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And, in the same way that Julius Cæsar, in himself invisible, is
          nevertheless perceived by sight; real things, in themselves
          imperceptible, are perceived by sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> In
          the very same.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Tell me, Hylas, when you behold the picture of Julius Cæsar, do you
          see with your eyes any more than some colours and figures, with a
          certain symmetry and composition of the whole?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Nothing else.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And would not a man who had never known anything of Julius Cæsar
          see as much?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> He
          would.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Consequently he hath his sight, and the use of it, in as perfect a
          degree as you?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          agree with you.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Whence comes it then that your thoughts are directed to the Roman
          emperor, and his are not? This cannot proceed from the sensations
          or ideas of sense by you then perceived; since you acknowledge you
          have no advantage over him in that respect. It should seem
          therefore to proceed from reason and memory: should it not?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          should.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Consequently, it will not follow from that instance that anything
          is perceived by sense which is not immediately perceived. Though I
          grant we may, in one acceptation, be said to perceive sensible
          things mediately by sense: that is, when, from a frequently
          perceived connexion, the immediate perception of ideas by one sense
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">suggests</span></em> to the mind others,
          perhaps belonging to another sense, which are wont to be connected
          with them. For instance, when I hear a coach drive along the
          streets, immediately I perceive only the sound; but, from the
          experience I have had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg
          416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          that such a sound is connected with a coach, I am said to hear the
          coach. It is nevertheless evident that, in truth and strictness,
          nothing can be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">heard</span></em> but <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sound</span></em>;
          and the coach is not properly perceived by sense, but suggested
          from experience. So likewise when we are said to see a red-hot bar
          of iron; the solidity and heat of the iron are not the objects of
          sight, but suggested to the imagination by the colour and figure
          which are properly perceived by that sense. In short, those things
          alone are actually and strictly perceived by any sense, which would
          have been perceived in case that same sense had then been first
          conferred on us. As for other things, it is plain they are only
          suggested to the mind by experience, grounded on former
          perceptions. But, to return to your comparison of Cæsar's picture,
          it is plain, if you keep to that, you must hold the real things, or
          archetypes of our ideas, are not perceived by sense, but by some
          internal faculty of the soul, as reason or memory. I would
          therefore fain know what arguments you can draw from reason for the
          existence of what you call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">real things</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          objects</span></em>. Or, whether you remember to have seen them
          formerly as they are in themselves; or, if you have heard or read
          of any one that did.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          see, Philonous, you are disposed to raillery; but that will never
          convince me.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          My aim is only to learn from you the way to come at the knowledge
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">material beings</span></em>. Whatever we
          perceive is perceived immediately or mediately: by sense, or by
          reason and reflexion. But, as you have excluded sense, pray shew me
          what reason you have to believe their existence; or what <em class=

          you can possibly make use of to prove it, either to mine or your
          own understanding.</p>

          deal ingenuously, Philonous, now I consider the point, I do not
          find I can give you any good reason for it. But, thus much seem
          pretty plain, that it is at least possible such things may really
          exist. And, as long as there is no absurdity in supposing them, I
          am resolved to believe as I did, till you bring good reasons to the
          contrary.</p>

          the existence of material objects, and that your belief is

          the possibility of its being true? Then you will have me bring
          reasons against it: though another would think it reasonable the
          proof should lie on him who holds the affirmative. And, after all,
          this very point which you are now resolved to maintain, without any
          reason, is in effect what you have more than once during this
          discourse seen good reason to give up. But, to pass over all this;
          if I understand you rightly, you say our ideas do not exist without
          the mind, but that they are copies, images, or representations, of
          certain originals that do?</p>

          Have those things a stable and permanent nature, independent of our
          senses; or are they in a perpetual change, upon our producing any
          motions in our bodies—suspending, exerting, or altering, our
          faculties or organs of sense?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Real things, it is plain, have a fixed and real nature, which
          remains the same notwithstanding any change in our senses, or in
          the posture and motion of our bodies; which indeed may affect the
          ideas in our minds, but it were absurd to think they had the same
          effect on things existing without the mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How then is it possible that things perpetually fleeting and
          variable as our ideas should be copies or images of anything fixed
          and constant? Or, in other words, since all sensible qualities, as
          size, figure, colour, &amp;c., that is, our ideas, are continually
          changing, upon every alteration in the distance, medium, or
          instruments of sensation; how can any determinate material objects
          be properly represented or painted forth by several distinct
          things, each of which is so different from and unlike the rest? Or,
          if you say it resembles some one only of our ideas, how shall we be
          able to distinguish the true copy from all the false ones?</p>

          But neither is this all. Which are material objects in
          themselves—perceptible or imperceptible?</p><span class=

          Properly and immediately nothing can be perceived but ideas. All
          material things, therefore, are in themselves insensible, and to be
          perceived only by our ideas.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Ideas then are sensible, and their archetypes or originals
          insensible?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          But how can that which is sensible be <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">like</span></em>
          that which is insensible? Can a real thing, in itself <em class=

          "font-style: italic">invisible</span></em>, be like a <em class=

          or a real thing, which is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">audible</span></em>, be like a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sound</span></em>?
          In a word, can anything be like a sensation or idea, but another
          sensation or idea?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Is it possible there should be any doubt on the point? Do you not

          Consider, therefore, and examine them, and then tell me if there be
          anything in them which can exist without the mind: or if you can
          conceive anything like them existing without the mind.</p>

          Upon inquiry, I find it is impossible for me to conceive or
          understand how anything but an idea can be like an idea. And it is
          most evident that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          You are therefore, by your principles, forced to deny the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reality</span></em> of sensible things; since
          you made it to consist in an absolute existence exterior to the
          mind. That is to say, you are a downright sceptic. So I have gained
          my point, which was to shew your principles led to Scepticism.</p>

          For the present I am, if not entirely convinced, at least
          silenced.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          would fain know what more you would require in order to a perfect
          conviction. Have you not had the liberty of explaining yourself all
          manner of ways? Were any little slips in discourse laid hold and
          insisted on? Or were you not allowed to retract or reinforce
          anything you had offered, as best served your purpose? Hath not
          everything you could say been heard and examined with <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all the fairness imaginable? In a word,
          have you not in every point been convinced out of your own mouth?
          And, if you can at present discover any flaw in any of your former
          concessions, or think of any remaining subterfuge, any new
          distinction, colour, or comment whatsoever, why do you not produce
          it?</p>

          little patience, Philonous. I am at present so amazed to see myself
          ensnared, and as it were imprisoned in the labyrinths you have
          drawn me into, that on the sudden it cannot be expected I should

          I beg your pardon, Philonous, for not meeting you sooner. All this
          morning my head was so filled with our late conversation that I had
          not leisure to think of the time of the day, or indeed of anything
          else.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          intent upon it, in hopes if there were any mistakes in your
          concessions, or fallacies in my reasonings from them, you will now
          discover them to me.</p>

          assure you I have done nothing ever since I saw you but search
          after mistakes and fallacies, and, with that view, have minutely
          examined the whole series of yesterday's discourse: but all in
          vain, for the notions it led me into, upon review, appear still
          more clear and evident; and, the more I consider them, the more
          irresistibly do they force my assent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          And is not this, think you, a sign that they are genuine, that they
          proceed from nature, and are conformable to right reason? Truth and
          beauty are in this alike, that the strictest survey sets them both
          off to advantage; while the false lustre of error and disguise
          cannot endure being reviewed, or too nearly inspected.</p>

          entirely satisfied of the truth of those odd consequences, so long

          are out of my thoughts, there seems, on the other hand, something

          is supposed the soul makes her residence in some part of the brain,
          from which the nerves take their rise, and are thence extended to
          all parts of the body; and that outward objects, by the different
          impressions they make on the organs of sense, communicate certain
          vibrative motions to the nerves; and these being filled with
          spirits propagate them to the brain or seat of the soul, which,
          according to the various impressions or traces thereby made in the
          brain, is variously affected with ideas<a id="noteref_820" name=

          would first know whether I rightly understand your hypothesis. You
          make certain traces in the brain to be the causes or occasions of
          our ideas. Pray tell me whether by the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brain</span></em>

          Sensible things are all immediately perceivable; and those things
          which are immediately perceivable are ideas; and these exist only
          in the mind. Thus much you have, if I mistake not, long since
          agreed to.</p>

          I would fain know whether you think it reasonable to suppose that
          one idea or thing existing in the mind occasions all other ideas.
          And, if you think so, pray how do you account for the origin of
          that primary idea or brain itself?</p>

          It comes, therefore, to the same thing; and you have been all this
          while accounting for ideas by certain motions or impressions of the
          brain; that is, by some alterations in an idea, whether sensible or
          imaginable it matters not.</p>

          Besides spirits, all that we know or conceive are our own ideas.
          When, therefore, you say all ideas are occasioned by impressions in
          the brain, do you conceive this brain or no? If you do, then you
          talk of ideas imprinted in an idea causing that same idea, which is
          absurd. If you do not conceive it, you talk unintelligibly, instead
          of forming a reasonable hypothesis.</p>

          You need not be much concerned at it; for after all, this way of
          explaining things, as you called it, could never have satisfied any
          reasonable man. What connexion is there between a motion in the
          nerves, and the sensations of sound or colour in the mind? Or how
          is it possible these should be the effect of that?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Look! are not the fields covered with a delightful verdure? Is
          there not something in the woods and groves, in the rivers and
          clear springs, that soothes, that delights, that transports the
          soul? At the prospect of the wide and deep ocean, or some huge
          mountain whose top is lost in the clouds, or of an old gloomy
          forest, are not our minds filled with a pleasing horror? Even in
          rocks and deserts is there not an agreeable wildness? How sincere a
          pleasure is it to behold the natural beauties of the earth! To
          preserve and renew our relish for them, is not the veil of night

          meanest productions of nature!] What delicacy, what beauty, what
          contrivance, in animal and vegetable bodies! How exquisitely are
          all things suited, as well to their particular ends, as to
          constitute opposite parts of the whole! And, while they mutually
          aid and support, do they not also set off and illustrate each
          other? Raise now your thoughts from this ball of earth to all those
          glorious luminaries that adorn the high arch of heaven. The motion
          and situation of the planets, are they not admirable for use and
          order? Were those (miscalled <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">erratic</span></em>) globes once known to
          stray, in their repeated journeys through the pathless void? Do
          they not measure areas round the sun ever proportioned to the
          times? So fixed, so immutable are the laws by which the unseen
          Author of nature actuates the universe. How vivid and radiant is
          the lustre of the fixed stars! How magnificent and rich that
          negligent profusion with which they appear to be scattered
          throughout the whole azure vault! Yet, if you take the telescope,
          it brings into your sight a new host of stars that escape the naked
          eye. Here they seem contiguous and minute, but to a nearer view
          immense orbs of light at various distances, far sunk in the abyss
          of space. Now you must call imagination to your aid. The feeble
          narrow sense cannot descry innumerable worlds revolving round the
          central fires; and in those worlds the energy of an all-perfect
          Mind displayed in endless forms. But, neither sense nor imagination
          are big enough to comprehend the boundless extent, with all its
          glittering furniture. Though the labouring mind exert and strain
          each power to its utmost reach, there still stands out ungrasped a
          surplusage immeasurable. Yet all the vast bodies that compose this
          mighty frame, how distant and remote soever, are by some secret
          mechanism, some Divine art and force, linked in a mutual dependence
          and intercourse with each other; even with this earth, which was
          almost slipt from my thoughts and lost in the crowd of worlds. Is
          not the whole system immense, beautiful, glorious beyond expression
          and beyond thought! What treatment, then, do those philosophers
          deserve, who would, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg

          Principles be entertained that lead us to think all the visible
          beauty of the creation a false imaginary glare? To be plain, can
          you expect this Scepticism of yours will not be thought
          extravagantly absurd by all men of sense?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Other men may think as they please; but for your part you have
          nothing to reproach me with. My comfort is, you are as much a
          sceptic as I am.</p>

          What! Have you all along agreed to the premises, and do you now
          deny the conclusion, and leave me to maintain those paradoxes by
          myself which you led me into? This surely is not fair.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          deny that I agreed with you in those notions that led to
          Scepticism. You indeed said the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em>
          of sensible things consisted in an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute existence
          out of the minds of spirits</span></em>, or distinct from their
          being perceived. And pursuant to this notion of reality, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> are
          obliged to deny sensible things any real existence: that is,
          according to your own definition, you profess yourself a sceptic.
          But I neither said nor thought the reality of sensible things was
          to be defined after that manner. To me it is evident, for the
          reasons you allow of, that sensible things cannot exist otherwise
          than in a mind or spirit. Whence I conclude, not that they have no
          real existence, but that, seeing they depend not on my thought, and
          have an existence distinct from being perceived by me<a id=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there
          must be some other Mind wherein they exist</span></em>. As sure,
          therefore, as the sensible world really exists, so sure is there an
          infinite omnipresent Spirit who contains and supports it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          What! This is no more than I and all Christians hold; nay, and all
          others too who believe there is a God, and that He knows and
          comprehends all things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Aye, but here lies the difference. Men commonly believe that all
          things are known or perceived by God, because they believe the
          being of a God; whereas I, on the other side, immediately and
          necessarily conclude the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg
          425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          being of a God, because all sensible things must be perceived by
          Him<a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825" href=
          "#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          But, so long as we all believe the same thing, what matter is it
          how we come by that belief?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But neither do we agree in the same opinion. For philosophers,
          though they acknowledge all corporeal beings to be perceived by
          God, yet they attribute to them an absolute subsistence distinct
          from their being perceived by any mind whatever; which I do not.
          Besides, is there no difference between saying, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">There is a God,
          therefore He perceives all things</span></em>; and saying,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sensible
          things do really exist; and, if they really exist, they are
          necessarily perceived by an infinite Mind: therefore there is an
          infinite Mind, or God</span><a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826"
          href="#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          This furnishes you with a direct and immediate demonstration, from
          a most evident principle, of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being of a
          God</span></em>. Divines and philosophers had proved beyond all
          controversy, from the beauty and usefulness of the several parts of
          the creation, that it was the workmanship of God. But that—setting
          aside all help of astronomy and natural philosophy, all
          contemplation of the contrivance, order, and adjustment of
          things—an infinite Mind should be necessarily inferred from<a id=

          bare <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">existence of the sensible world</span></em>,
          is an advantage to them only who have made this easy reflexion:
          That the sensible world is that which we perceive by our several
          senses; and that nothing is perceived by the senses beside ideas;
          and that no idea or archetype of an idea can exist otherwise than
          in a mind. You may now, without any laborious search into the
          sciences, without any subtlety of reason, or tedious length of
          discourse, oppose and baffle the most strenuous advocate for
          Atheism. Those miserable refuges, whether in an eternal succession
          of unthinking causes and effects, or in a fortuitous concourse of
          atoms; those wild imaginations of Vanini, Hobbes, and Spinoza: in a
          word, the whole system of Atheism, is it not entirely overthrown,
          by this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg

          single reflexion on the repugnancy included in supposing the whole,
          or any part, even the most rude and shapeless, of the visible
          world, to exist without a Mind? Let any one of those abettors of
          impiety but look into his own thoughts, and there try if he can
          conceive how so much as a rock, a desert, a chaos, or confused
          jumble of atoms; how anything at all, either sensible or
          imaginable, can exist independent of a Mind, and he need go no
          farther to be convinced of his folly. Can anything be fairer than
          to put a dispute on such an issue, and leave it to a man himself to
          see if he can conceive, even in thought, what he holds to be true
          in fact, and from a notional to allow it a real existence<a id=

          They conceive that the soul, being immaterial, is incapable of
          being united with material things, so as to perceive them in
          themselves; but that she perceives them by her union with the
          substance of God, which, being spiritual, is therefore purely
          intelligible, or capable of being the immediate object of a
          spirit's thought. Besides, the Divine essence contains in it
          perfections correspondent to each created being; and which are, for
          that reason, proper to exhibit or represent them to the mind.</p>

          be the essence, or any part (or like any part) of the essence or
          substance of God, who is an impassive, indivisible, pure, active
          being. Many more difficulties and objections there are which occur
          at first view against this hypothesis; but I shall only

          liable to all the absurdities of the common hypothesis, in making a
          created world exist otherwise than in the mind of a Spirit. Beside
          all which it hath this peculiar to itself; that it makes that
          material world serve to no purpose. And, if it pass for a good
          argument against other hypotheses in the sciences, that they
          suppose Nature, or the Divine wisdom, to make something in vain, or
          do that by tedious roundabout methods which might have been
          performed in a much more easy and compendious way, what shall we

          men think; yet all have opinions. Hence men's opinions are
          superficial and confused. It is nothing strange that tenets which
          in themselves are ever so different, should nevertheless be
          confounded with each other, by those who do not consider them
          attentively. I shall not therefore be surprised if some men imagine
          that I run into the enthusiasm of Malebranche; though in truth I am
          very remote from it. He builds on the most abstract general ideas,
          which I entirely disclaim. He asserts an absolute external world,
          which I deny. He maintains that we are deceived by our senses, and
          know not the real natures or the true forms and figures of extended
          beings; of all which I hold the direct contrary. So that upon the
          whole there are no Principles more fundamentally opposite than his
          and mine. It must be owned that] I entirely agree with what the
          holy Scripture saith, 'That in God we live and move and have our
          being.' But that we see things in His essence, after the manner
          above set forth, I am far from believing. Take here in brief my
          meaning:—It is evident that the things I perceive are my own ideas,
          and that no idea can exist unless it be in a mind: nor is it less
          plain that these ideas or things by me perceived, either themselves
          or their archetypes, exist independently of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em>
          mind, since I know myself not to be their author, it being out of
          my power to determine at pleasure what particular ideas I shall be
          affected with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg
          428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          upon opening my eyes or ears<a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832"
          href="#note_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a>: they
          must therefore exist in some other Mind, whose Will it is they
          should be exhibited to me. The things, I say, immediately perceived
          are ideas or sensations, call them which you will. But how can any
          idea or sensation exist in, or be produced by, anything but a mind
          or spirit? This indeed is inconceivable<a id="noteref_833" name=
          "noteref_833" href="#note_833"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a>. And
          to assert that which is inconceivable is to talk nonsense: is it
          not?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Without doubt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, on the other hand, it is very conceivable that they should
          exist in and be produced by a Spirit; since this is no more than I
          daily experience in myself<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834"
          href="#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a>,
          inasmuch as I perceive numberless ideas; and, by an act of my will,
          can form a great variety of them, and raise them up in my
          imagination: though, it must be confessed, these creatures of the
          fancy are not altogether so distinct, so strong, vivid, and
          permanent, as those perceived by my senses—which latter are called
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real
          things</span></em>. From all which I conclude, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there is a Mind
          which affects me every moment with all the sensible impressions I
          perceive</span></em>. And, from the variety, order, and manner of
          these, I conclude <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the Author of them to be wise, powerful, and
          good, beyond comprehension</span></em>. Mark it well; I do not say
          I see things by perceiving that which represents them in the
          intelligible Substance of God. This I do not understand; but I say,
          the things by me perceived are known by the understanding, and
          produced by the will of an infinite Spirit. And is not all this
          most plain and evident? Is there any more in it than what a little
          observation in our own minds, and that which passeth in them, not
          only enables us to conceive, but also obliges us to
          acknowledge?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          think I understand you very clearly; and own proof you give of a
          Deity seems no less evident than it is surprising. But, allowing
          that God is the supreme and universal Cause of all things, yet, may
          there not be still a Third Nature besides Spirits and Ideas? May we
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a name=
          "Pg429" id="Pg429" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not admit a
          subordinate and limited cause of our ideas? In a word, may there
          not for all that be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How often must I inculcate the same thing? You allow the things
          immediately perceived by sense to exist nowhere without the mind;
          but there is nothing perceived by sense which is not perceived
          immediately; therefore there is nothing sensible that exists
          without the mind. The Matter, therefore, which you still insist on
          is something intelligible, I suppose; something that may be
          discovered by reason<a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href=
          "#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          not by sense.</p>

          Pray let me know what reasoning your belief of Matter is grounded
          on; and what this Matter is, in your present sense of it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          find myself affected with various ideas whereof I know I am not the
          cause; neither are they the cause of themselves, or of one another,
          or capable of subsisting by themselves, as being altogether
          inactive, fleeting, dependent beings. They have therefore
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">some</span></em> cause distinct from me and
          them: of which I pretend to know no more than that it is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the cause of my
          ideas</span></em>. And this thing whatever it be, I call
          Matter.</p>

          Tell me, Hylas, hath every one a liberty to change the current
          proper signification attached to a common name in any language? For
          example, suppose a traveller should tell you that in a certain
          country men pass unhurt through the fire; and, upon explaining
          himself, you found he meant by the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fire</span></em>
          that which others call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">water</span></em>. Or, if he should assert
          that there are trees that walk upon two legs, meaning men by the
          term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">trees</span></em>. Would you think this
          reasonable?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          No; I should think it very absurd. Common custom is the standard of
          propriety in language. And for any man to affect speaking
          improperly is to pervert the use of speech, and can never serve to
          a better purpose than to protract and multiply disputes where there
          is no difference in opinion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          And doth not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          acceptation of the word, signify an extended solid moveable,
          unthinking, inactive Substance?</p>

          substance can possibly exist<a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836"

          though it should be allowed to exist, yet how can that which is

          word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> a contrary meaning to what
          is vulgarly received; and tell me you understand by it, an
          unextended, thinking, active being, which is the cause of our
          ideas. But what else is this than to play with words, and run into
          that very fault you just now condemned with so much reason? I do by
          no means find fault with your reasoning, in that you collect
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a</span></em> cause from the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">phenomena</span></em>: but I deny that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the</span></em> cause deducible by reason can
          properly be termed Matter<a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837"

          There is indeed something in what you say. But I am afraid you do
          not thoroughly comprehend my meaning. I would by no means be
          thought to deny that God, or an infinite Spirit, is the Supreme
          Cause of all things. All I contend for is, that, subordinate to the
          Supreme Agent, there is a cause of a limited and inferior nature,
          which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">concurs</span></em> in the production of our
          ideas, not by any act of will, or spiritual efficiency, but by that
          kind of action which belongs to Matter, viz. <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">motion</span></em>.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          find you are at every turn relapsing into your old exploded
          conceit, of a moveable, and consequently an extended, substance,
          existing without the mind. What! Have you already forgotten you
          were convinced; or are you willing I should repeat what has been
          said on that head? In truth this is not fair dealing in you, still
          to suppose the being of that which you have so often acknowledged
          to have no being. But, not to insist farther on what has been so
          largely handled, I ask whether all your ideas are not perfectly
          passive and inert, including nothing of action in them<a id=

          And are sensible qualities anything else but ideas?</p><span class=

          How often have I acknowledged that they are not.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">motion</span></em> a sensible quality?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Consequently it is no action?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          agree with you. And indeed it is very plain that when I stir my
          finger, it remains passive; but my will which produced the motion
          is active.</p>

          Now, I desire to know, in the first place, whether, motion being
          allowed to be no action, you can conceive any action besides
          volition: and, in the second place, whether to say something and
          conceive nothing be not to talk nonsense<a id="noteref_839" name=

          lastly, whether, having considered the premises, you do not
          perceive that to suppose any efficient or active Cause of our
          ideas, other than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          give up the point entirely. But, though Matter may not be a cause,
          yet what hinders its being an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          supreme Agent in the production of our ideas?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          An instrument say you; pray what may be the figure, springs,
          wheels, and motions, of that instrument?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Those I pretend to determine nothing of, both the substance and its
          qualities being entirely unknown to me.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What? You are then of opinion it is made up of unknown parts, that
          it hath unknown motions, and an unknown shape?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          do not believe that it hath any figure or motion at all, being
          already convinced, that no sensible qualities can exist in an
          unperceiving substance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But what notion is it possible to frame of an instrument void of

          And what reason have you to think this unknown, this inconceivable
          Somewhat doth exist? Is it that you imagine God cannot act as well
          without it; or that you find by experience the use of some such
          thing, when you form ideas in your own mind?</p><span class=

          It is to me a sufficient reason not to believe the existence of
          anything, if I see no reason for believing it. But, not to insist
          on reasons for believing, you will not so much as let me know
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what it
          is</span></em> you would have me believe; since you say you have no
          manner of notion of it. After all, let me entreat you to consider
          whether it be like a philosopher, or even like a man of common
          sense, to pretend to believe you know not what, and you know not
          why.</p>

          altogether nothing. It is true I know not the particular kind of
          instrument; but, however, I have some notion of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instrument in
          general</span></em>, which I apply to it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But what if it should prove that there is something, even in the
          most general notion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">instrument</span></em>, as taken in a distinct
          sense from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cause</span></em>, which makes the use of it
          inconsistent with the Divine attributes?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Make that appear and I shall give up the point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What mean you by the general nature or notion of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">instrument</span></em>?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That which is common to all particular instruments composeth the
          general notion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is it not common to all instruments, that they are applied to the
          doing those things only which cannot be performed by the mere act
          of our wills? Thus, for instance, I never use an instrument to move
          my finger, because it is done by a volition. But I should use one
          if I were to remove part of a rock, or tear up a tree by the roots.
          Are you of the same mind? Or, can you shew any example where an
          instrument is made use of in producing an effect <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">immediately</span></em> depending on the will
          of the agent?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          own I cannot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How therefore can you suppose that an All-perfect Spirit, on whose
          Will all things have an absolute and immediate dependence, should
          need an instrument in his operations, or, not needing it, make use
          of it? Thus it seems to me that you are obliged to own the use of a
          lifeless inactive instrument to be incompatible with the infinite
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name=
          "Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> perfection of God;
          that is, by your own confession, to give up the point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          doth not readily occur what I can answer you.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, methinks you should be ready to own the truth, when it has
          been fairly proved to you. We indeed, who are beings of finite
          powers, are forced to make use of instruments. And the use of an
          instrument sheweth the agent to be limited by rules of another's
          prescription, and that he cannot obtain his end but in such a way,
          and by such conditions. Whence it seems a clear consequence, that
          the supreme unlimited Agent useth no tool or instrument at all. The
          will of an Omnipotent Spirit is no sooner exerted than executed,
          without the application of means; which, if they are employed by
          inferior agents, it is not upon account of any real efficacy that
          is in them, or necessary aptitude to produce any effect, but merely
          in compliance with the laws of nature, or those conditions
          prescribed to them by the First Cause, who is Himself above all
          limitation or prescription whatsoever<a id="noteref_840" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          will no longer maintain that Matter is an instrument. However, I
          would not be understood to give up its existence neither; since,
          notwithstanding what hath been said, it may still be an <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em><a id="noteref_841" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          How many shapes is your Matter to take? Or, how often must it be
          proved not to exist, before you are content to part with it? But,
          to say no more of this (though by all the laws of disputation I may
          justly blame you for so frequently changing the signification of
          the principal term)—I would fain know what you mean by affirming
          that matter is an occasion, having already denied it to be a cause.
          And, when you have shewn in what sense you understand <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em>, pray, in the next place,
          be pleased to shew me what reason induceth you to believe there is
          such an occasion of our ideas?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> As
          to the first point: by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em> I mean an inactive
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name=
          "Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> unthinking being, at
          the presence whereof God excites ideas in our minds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And what may be the nature of that inactive unthinking being?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          know nothing of its nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Proceed then to the second point, and assign some reason why we
          should allow an existence to this inactive, unthinking, unknown
          thing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          When we see ideas produced in our minds, after an orderly and
          constant manner, it is natural to think they have some fixed and
          regular occasions, at the presence of which they are excited.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          You acknowledge then God alone to be the cause of our ideas, and
          that He causes them at the presence of those occasions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That is my opinion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Those things which you say are present to God, without doubt He
          perceives.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Certainly; otherwise they could not be to Him an occasion of
          acting.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Not to insist now on your making sense of this hypothesis, or
          answering all the puzzling questions and difficulties it is liable
          to: I only ask whether the order and regularity observable in the
          series of our ideas, or the course of nature, be not sufficiently
          accounted for by the wisdom and power of God; and whether it doth
          not derogate from those attributes, to suppose He is influenced,
          directed, or put in mind, when and what He is to act, by an
          unthinking substance? And, lastly, whether, in case I granted all
          you contend for, it would make anything to your purpose; it not
          being easy to conceive how the external or absolute existence of an
          unthinking substance, distinct from its being perceived, can be
          inferred from my allowing that there are certain things perceived
          by the mind of God, which are to Him the occasion of producing
          ideas in us?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          am perfectly at a loss what to think, this notion of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">occasion</span></em> seeming now altogether as
          groundless as the rest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Do you not at length perceive that in all these different
          acceptations of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, you have been only
          supposing you know not what, for no manner of reason, and to no
          kind of use?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg
          435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          freely own myself less fond of my notions since they have been so
          accurately examined. But still, methinks, I have some confused
          perception that there is such a thing as <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Either you perceive the being of Matter immediately or mediately.
          If immediately, pray inform me by which of the senses you perceive
          it. If mediately, let me know by what reasoning it is inferred from
          those things which you perceive immediately. So much for the
          perception. Then for the Matter itself, I ask whether it is object,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em>, cause, instrument, or
          occasion? You have already pleaded for each of these, shifting your
          notions, and making Matter to appear sometimes in one shape, then
          in another. And what you have offered hath been disapproved and
          rejected by yourself. If you have anything new to advance I would
          gladly hear it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          think I have already offered all I had to say on those heads. I am
          at a loss what more to urge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And yet you are loath to part with your old prejudice. But, to make
          you quit it more easily, I desire that, beside what has been
          hitherto suggested, you will farther consider whether, upon
          supposition that Matter exists, you can possibly conceive how you
          should be affected by it. Or, supposing it did not exist, whether
          it be not evident you might for all that be affected with the same
          ideas you now are, and consequently have the very same reasons to
          believe its existence that you now can have<a id="noteref_842"
          name="noteref_842" href="#note_842"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          acknowledge it is possible we might perceive all things just as we
          do now, though there was no Matter in the world; neither can I
          conceive, if there be Matter, how it should produce any idea in our
          minds. And, I do farther grant you have entirely satisfied me that
          it is impossible there should be such a thing as Matter in any of
          the foregoing acceptations. But still I cannot help supposing that
          there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> in some sense or other.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">What that
          is</span></em> I do not indeed pretend to determine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          do not expect you should define exactly the nature of that unknown
          being. Only be pleased to tell me whether it is a Substance; and if
          so, whether you can <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg
          436]</span><a name="Pg436" id="Pg436" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          suppose a Substance without accidents; or, in case you suppose it
          to have accidents or qualities, I desire you will let me know what
          those qualities are, at least what is meant by Matter's supporting
          them?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> We
          have already argued on those points. I have no more to say to them.
          But, to prevent any farther questions, let me tell you I at present
          understand by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> neither substance nor
          accident, thinking nor extended being, neither cause, instrument,
          nor occasion, but Something entirely unknown, distinct from all
          these<a id="noteref_843" name="noteref_843" href=
          "#note_843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It seems then you include in your present notion of Matter nothing
          but the general abstract idea of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">entity</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Nothing else; save only that I superadd to this general idea the
          negation of all those particular things, qualities, or ideas, that
          I perceive, imagine, or in anywise apprehend.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Pray where do you suppose this unknown Matter to exist?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> Oh
          Philonous! now you think you have entangled me; for, if I say it
          exists in place, then you will infer that it exists in the mind,
          since it is agreed that place or extension exists only in the mind.
          But I am not ashamed to own my ignorance. I know not where it
          exists; only I am sure it exists not in place. There is a negative
          answer for you. And you must expect no other to all the questions
          you put for the future about Matter.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Since you will not tell me where it exists, be pleased to inform me
          after what manner you suppose it to exist, or what you mean by its

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Upon a nice observation, I do not find I have any positive notion
          or meaning at all. I tell you again, I am not ashamed to own my
          ignorance. I know not what is meant by its <em class=

          Continue, good Hylas, to act the same ingenuous part, and tell me

          Hold, let me think a little——I profess, Philonous, I do not find
          that I can. At first glance, methought I had some dilute and airy
          notion of Pure Entity in abstract; but, upon closer attention, it
          hath quite vanished out of sight. The more I think on it, the more
          am I confirmed in my prudent resolution of giving none but negative
          answers, and not pretending to the least degree of any positive
          knowledge or conception of Matter, its <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where</span></em>,
          its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">how</span></em>, its <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entity</span></em>,
          or anything belonging to it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          When, therefore, you speak of the existence of Matter, you have not
          any notion in your mind?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          None at all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Pray tell me if the case stands not thus:—At first, from a belief
          of material substance, you would have it that the immediate objects
          existed without the mind; then that they are archetypes; then
          causes; next instruments; then occasions: lastly, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something in
          general</span></em>, which being interpreted proves <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>. So Matter comes to
          nothing. What think you, Hylas, is not this a fair summary of your
          whole proceeding?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> Be
          that as it will, yet I still insist upon it, that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> not
          being able to conceive a thing is no argument against its
          existence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          That from a cause, effect, operation, sign, or other circumstance,
          there may reasonably be inferred the existence of a thing not
          immediately perceived; and that it were absurd for any man to argue
          against the existence of that thing, from his having no direct and
          positive notion of it, I freely own. But, where there is nothing of
          all this; where neither reason nor revelation induces us to believe
          the existence of a thing; where we have not even a relative notion
          of it; where an abstraction is made from perceiving and being
          perceived, from Spirit and idea: lastly, where there is not so much
          as the most inadequate or faint idea pretended to—I will not indeed
          thence conclude against the reality of any notion, or existence of
          anything; but my inference shall be, that you mean nothing at all;
          that you employ words to no manner of purpose, without <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a name="Pg438" id="Pg438"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> any design or signification whatsoever.
          And I leave it to you to consider how mere jargon should be
          treated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> To
          deal frankly with you, Philonous, your arguments seem in themselves
          unanswerable; but they have not so great an effect on me as to
          produce that entire conviction, that hearty acquiescence, which
          attends demonstration<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href=
          "#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a>. I
          find myself still relapsing into an obscure surmise of I know not
          what, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">matter</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, are you not sensible, Hylas, that two things must concur to
          take away all scruple, and work a plenary assent in the mind? Let a
          visible object be set in never so clear a light, yet, if there is
          any imperfection in the sight, or if the eye is not directed
          towards it, it will not be distinctly seen. And though a
          demonstration be never so well grounded and fairly proposed, yet,
          if there is withal a stain of prejudice, or a wrong bias on the
          understanding, can it be expected on a sudden to perceive clearly,
          and adhere firmly to the truth? No; there is need of time and
          pains: the attention must be awakened and detained by a frequent
          repetition of the same thing placed oft in the same, oft in
          different lights. I have said it already, and find I must still
          repeat and inculcate, that it is an unaccountable licence you take,
          in pretending to maintain you know not what, for you know not what
          reason, to you know not what purpose. Can this be paralleled in any
          art or science, any sect or profession of men? Or is there anything
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">so</span></em> barefacedly groundless and
          unreasonable to be met with even in the lowest of common
          conversation? But, perhaps you will still say, Matter may exist;
          though at the same time you neither know <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what is
          meant</span></em> by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">existence</span></em>. This indeed is
          surprising, and the more so because it is altogether voluntary
          [<a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href=

          head], you not being led to it by any one reason; for I challenge
          you to shew me that thing in nature which needs Matter to explain
          or account for it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reality</span></em> of things cannot be
          maintained without supposing the existence of Matter. And is not
          this, think you, a good reason why I should be earnest in its
          defence?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          The reality of things! What things? sensible or intelligible?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>

          My glove for example?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That, or any other thing perceived by the senses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But to fix on some particular thing. Is it not a sufficient
          evidence to me of the existence of this <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">glove</span></em>,
          that I see it, and feel it, and wear it? Or, if this will not do,
          how is it possible I should be assured of the reality of this
          thing, which I actually see in this place, by supposing that some
          unknown thing, which I never did or can see, exists after an
          unknown manner, in an unknown place, or in no place at all? How can
          the supposed reality of that which is intangible be a proof that
          anything tangible really exists? Or, of that which is invisible,
          that any visible thing, or, in general of anything which is
          imperceptible, that a perceptible exists? Do but explain this and I
          shall think nothing too hard for you.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Upon the whole, I am content to own the existence of Matter is
          highly improbable; but the direct and absolute impossibility of it
          does not appear to me.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But granting Matter to be possible, yet, upon that account merely,
          it can have no more claim to existence than a golden mountain, or a
          centaur.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          acknowledge it; but still you do not deny it is possible; and that
          which is possible, for aught you know, may actually exist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          deny it to be possible; and have, if I mistake not, evidently
          proved, from your own concessions, that it is not. In the common
          sense of the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, is there any more implied
          than an extended, solid, figured, moveable substance, existing
          without the mind? And have not you acknowledged, over and over,
          that you have seen evident reason for denying the possibility of
          such a substance?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          True, but that is only one sense of the term <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But is it not the only proper genuine received sense? And, if
          Matter, in such a sense, be proved impossible, may it not be
          thought with good grounds absolutely impossible? Else how could
          anything be proved impossible? Or, indeed, how could there be any
          proof at all one way or other, to a man who takes the liberty to
          unsettle and change the common signification of words?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          thought philosophers might be allowed to speak more accurately than
          the vulgar, and were not always confined to the common acceptation
          of a term.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But this now mentioned is the common received sense among
          philosophers themselves. But, not to insist on that, have you not
          been allowed to take Matter in what sense you pleased? And have you
          not used this privilege in the utmost extent; sometimes entirely
          changing, at others leaving out, or putting into the definition of
          it whatever, for the present, best served your design, contrary to
          all the known rules of reason and logic? And hath not this
          shifting, unfair method of yours spun out our dispute to an
          unnecessary length; Matter having been particularly examined, and
          by your own confession refuted in each of those senses? And can any
          more be required to prove the absolute impossibility of a thing,
          than the proving it impossible in every particular sense that
          either you or any one else understands it in?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          But I am not so thoroughly satisfied that you have proved the
          impossibility of Matter, in the last most obscure abstracted and
          indefinite sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          When is a thing shewn to be impossible?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          When a repugnancy is demonstrated between the ideas comprehended in
          its definition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But where there are no ideas, there no repugnancy can be
          demonstrated between ideas?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          agree with you.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Now, in that which you call the obscure indefinite sense of the
          word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, it is plain, by your own
          confession, there was included no idea at all, no sense except an
          unknown sense; which is the same thing as none. You are not,
          therefore, to expect I should prove a repugnancy between ideas,
          where there are no ideas; or the impossibility of Matter taken in
          an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unknown</span></em> sense, that is, no sense
          at all. My business was only to shew you meant <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>; and this you were brought
          to own. So that, in all your various senses, you have been shewed
          either to mean nothing at all, or, if anything, an absurdity. And
          if this be not sufficient to prove the impossibility of a thing, I
          desire you will let me know what is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          acknowledge you have proved that Matter is impossible; nor do I see
          what more can be said in defence of it. But, at the same time that
          I give up this, I suspect all my other notions. For surely none
          could be more seemingly evident than this once was: and yet it now
          seems as false and absurd as ever it did true before. But I think
          we have discussed the point sufficiently for the present. The
          remaining part of the day I would willingly spend in running over
          in my thoughts the several heads of this morning's conversation,
          and to-morrow shall be glad to meet you here again about the same
          time.</p>

          Truly my opinion is that all our opinions are alike vain and
          uncertain. What we approve to-day, we condemn to-morrow. We keep a
          stir about knowledge, and spend our lives in the pursuit of it,
          when, alas! we know nothing all the while: nor do I think it
          possible for us ever to know anything in this life. Our faculties
          are too narrow and too few. Nature certainly never intended us for
          speculation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What! Say you we can know nothing, Hylas?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          There is not that single thing in the world whereof we can know the
          real nature, or what it is in itself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          You may indeed know that fire appears hot, and water fluid; but
          this is no more than knowing what sensations are produced in your
          own mind, upon the application of fire and water to your organs of
          sense. Their internal constitution, their true and real nature, you
          are utterly in the dark as to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">that</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Do I not know this to be a real stone that I stand on, and that
          which I see before my eyes to be a real tree?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Know?</span></em> No, it is impossible you or
          any man alive should know it. All you know is, that you have such a
          certain idea or appearance in your own mind. But what is this to
          the real tree or stone? I tell you that colour, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a name="Pg443" id="Pg443"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> figure, and hardness, which you
          perceive, are not the real natures of those things, or in the least
          like them. The same may be said of all other real things, or
          corporeal substances, which compose the world. They have none of
          them anything of themselves, like those sensible qualities by us
          perceived. We should not therefore pretend to affirm or know
          anything of them, as they are in their own nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But surely, Hylas, I can distinguish gold, for example, from iron:
          and how could this be, if I knew not what either truly was?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Believe me, Philonous, you can only distinguish between your own
          ideas. That yellowness, that weight, and other sensible qualities,
          think you they are really in the gold? They are only relative to
          the senses, and have no absolute existence in nature. And in
          pretending to distinguish the species of real things, by the
          appearances in your mind, you may perhaps act as wisely as he that
          should conclude two men were of a different species, because their
          clothes were not of the same colour.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It seems, then, we are altogether put off with the appearances of
          things, and those false ones too. The very meat I eat, and the
          cloth I wear, have nothing in them like what I see and feel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Even so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But is it not strange the whole world should be thus imposed on,
          and so foolish as to believe their senses? And yet I know not how
          it is, but men eat, and drink, and sleep, and perform all the
          offices of life, as comfortably and conveniently as if they really
          knew the things they are conversant about.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          They do so: but you know ordinary practice does not require a
          nicety of speculative knowledge. Hence the vulgar retain their
          mistakes, and for all that make a shift to bustle through the
          affairs of life. But philosophers know better things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          You mean, they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">know</span></em> that they <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          That is the very top and perfection of human knowledge.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But are you all this while in earnest, Hylas; and are you seriously
          persuaded that you know nothing real in the world? Suppose you are
          going to write, would you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg
          444]</span><a name="Pg444" id="Pg444" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          not call for pen, ink, and paper, like another man; and do you not
          know what it is you call for?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          How often must I tell you, that I know not the real nature of any
          one thing in the universe? I may indeed upon occasion make use of
          pen, ink, and paper. But what any one of them is in its own true
          nature, I declare positively I know not. And the same is true with
          regard to every other corporeal thing. And, what is more, we are
          not only ignorant of the true and real nature of things, but even
          of their existence. It cannot be denied that we perceive such
          certain appearances or ideas; but it cannot be concluded from
          thence that bodies really exist. Nay, now I think on it, I must,
          agreeably to my former concessions, farther declare that it is
          impossible any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">real</span></em> corporeal thing should exist
          in nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          You amaze me. Was ever anything more wild and extravagant than the
          notions you now maintain: and is it not evident you are led into
          all these extravagances by the belief of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          substance</span></em>? This makes you dream of those unknown
          natures<a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href=
          "#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a> in
          everything. It is this occasions your distinguishing between the
          reality and sensible appearances of things. It is to this you are
          indebted for being ignorant of what everybody else knows perfectly
          well. Nor is this all: you are not only ignorant of the true nature
          of everything, but you know not whether anything really exists, or
          whether there are any true natures at all; forasmuch as you
          attribute to your material beings an absolute or external
          existence, wherein you suppose their reality consists. And, as you
          are forced in the end to acknowledge such an existence means either
          a direct repugnancy, or nothing at all, it follows that you are
          obliged to pull down your own hypothesis of material Substance, and
          positively to deny the real existence of any part of the universe.
          And so you are plunged into the deepest and most deplorable
          scepticism that ever man was<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849"

          agree with you. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          than an hypothesis; and a false and groundless one too. I will no
          longer spend my breath in defence of it. But whatever hypothesis
          you advance, or whatsoever scheme of things you introduce in its
          stead, I doubt not it will appear every whit as false: let me but
          be allowed to question you upon it. That is, suffer me to serve you
          in your own kind, and I warrant it shall conduct you through as
          many perplexities and contradictions, to the very same state of
          scepticism that I myself am in at present.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          assure you, Hylas, I do not pretend to frame any hypothesis at
          all<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a>. I am
          of a vulgar cast, simple enough to believe my senses, and leave
          things as I find them. To be plain, it is my opinion that the real
          things are those very things I see, and feel, and perceive<a id=
          "noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href="#note_851"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a> by my
          senses. These I know; and, finding they answer all the necessities
          and purposes of life, have no reason to be solicitous about any
          other unknown beings. A piece of sensible bread, for instance,
          would stay my stomach better than ten thousand times as much of
          that insensible, unintelligible, real bread you speak of. It is
          likewise my opinion that colours and other sensible qualities are
          on the objects. I cannot for my life help thinking that snow is
          white, and fire hot. You indeed, who by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">snow</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">fire</span></em> mean certain external,
          unperceived, unperceiving substances, are in the right to deny
          whiteness or heat to be affections inherent in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>.
          But I, who understand by those words the things I see and feel, am
          obliged to think like other folks. And, as I am no sceptic with
          regard to the nature of things, so neither am I as to their
          existence. That a thing should be really perceived by my
          senses<a id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852" href=
          "#note_852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a>, and
          at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name=
          "Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the same time not
          really exist, is to me a plain contradiction; since I cannot
          prescind or abstract, even in thought, the existence of a sensible
          thing from its being perceived. Wood, stones, fire, water, flesh,
          iron, and the like things, which I name and discourse of, are
          things that I know. And I should not have known them but that I
          perceived them by my senses; and things perceived by the senses are
          immediately perceived; and things immediately perceived are ideas;
          and ideas cannot exist without the mind; their existence therefore
          consists in being perceived; when, therefore, they are actually
          perceived there can be no doubt of their existence. Away then with
          all that scepticism, all those ridiculous philosophical doubts.
          What a jest is it for a philosopher to question the existence of
          sensible things, till he hath it proved to him from the veracity of
          God<a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853" href=
          "#note_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          to pretend our knowledge in this point falls short of intuition or

          might as well doubt of my own being, as of the being of those
          things I actually see and feel.</p>

          Not so fast, Philonous: you say you cannot conceive how sensible
          things should exist without the mind. Do you not?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Supposing you were annihilated, cannot you conceive it possible

          can; but then it must be in another mind. When I deny sensible
          things an existence out of the mind, I do not mean my mind in
          particular, but all minds. Now, it is plain they have an existence
          exterior to my mind; since I find them by experience to be
          independent of it<a id="noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href=
          "#note_856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          other Mind wherein they exist, during the intervals between the
          times of my perceiving them: as likewise they did before my birth,
          and would do after my supposed annihilation. And, as the same is
          true with regard to all other finite created spirits, it
          necessarily follows there is an <em class=

          Mind</span></em>, which knows and comprehends all things, and

          And is not God an agent, a being purely active?</p>

          Since therefore you have no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          you conceive it possible that things should exist in His mind? Or,
          if you can conceive the mind of God, without having an idea of it,
          why may not I be allowed to conceive the existence of Matter,
          notwithstanding I have no idea of it?</p>

          As to your first question: I own I have properly no <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">idea</span></em>,
          either of God or any other spirit; for these being active, cannot
          be represented by things perfectly inert, as our ideas are. I do
          nevertheless know that I, who am a spirit or thinking substance,
          exist as certainly as I know my ideas exist<a id="noteref_859"
          name="noteref_859" href="#note_859"><span class=

          Farther, I know what I mean by the terms <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em> and
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">myself</span></em>; and I know this

          "page448">[pg 448]</span><a name="Pg448" id="Pg448" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> though I do not perceive it as I perceive a
          triangle, a colour, or a sound. The Mind, Spirit, or Soul is that
          indivisible unextended thing which thinks, acts, and perceives. I
          say <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">indivisible</span></em>, because unextended;
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unextended</span></em>, because extended,
          figured, moveable things are ideas; and that which perceives ideas,
          which thinks and wills, is plainly itself no idea, nor like an
          idea. Ideas are things inactive, and perceived. And Spirits a sort
          of beings altogether different from them. I do not therefore say my
          soul is an idea, or like an idea. However, taking the word
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em> in a large sense, my soul may
          be said to furnish me with an idea, that is, an image or likeness
          of God—though indeed extremely inadequate. For, all the notion I
          have of God is obtained by reflecting on my own soul, heightening
          its powers, and removing its imperfections. I have, therefore,
          though not an inactive idea, yet in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">myself</span></em>
          some sort of an active thinking image of the Deity. And, though I
          perceive Him not by sense, yet I have a notion of Him, or know Him
          by reflexion and reasoning. My own mind and my own ideas I have an
          immediate knowledge of; and, by the help of these, do mediately
          apprehend the possibility of the existence of other spirits and
          ideas<a id="noteref_860" name="noteref_860" href=

          You say your own soul supplies you with some sort of an idea or
          image of God. But, at the same time, you acknowledge you have,
          properly speaking, no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em> of your own soul. You even
          affirm that spirits are a sort of beings altogether different from
          ideas. Consequently that no idea can be like a spirit. We have
          therefore no idea of any spirit. You admit nevertheless that there
          is spiritual Substance, although you have no idea of it; while you
          deny there can be such a thing as material Substance, because you
          have no notion or idea of it. Is this fair dealing? To act
          consistently, you must either admit Matter or reject Spirit. What
          say you to this?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          say, in the first place, that I do not deny the existence of
          material substance, merely because I have no notion of it, but
          because the notion of it is inconsistent; or, in other words,
          because it is repugnant that there should be a notion of it. Many
          things, for aught I know, may exist, whereof neither I nor any
          other man hath or can have any idea or notion whatsoever. But then
          those things must be possible, that is, nothing inconsistent must
          be included in their definition. I say, secondly, that, although we
          believe things to exist which we do not perceive, yet we may not
          believe that any particular thing exists, without some reason for
          such belief: but I have no reason for believing the existence of
          Matter. I have no immediate intuition thereof: neither can I
          immediately from my sensations, ideas, notions, actions, or
          passions, infer an unthinking, unperceiving, inactive
          Substance—either by probable deduction, or necessary consequence.
          Whereas the being of my Self, that is, my own soul, mind, or
          thinking principle, I evidently know by reflexion<a id=

          if I repeat the same things in answer to the same objections. In
          the very notion or definition of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          Substance</span></em>, there is included a manifest repugnance and
          inconsistency. But this cannot be said of the notion of Spirit.
          That ideas should exist in what doth not perceive, or be produced
          by what doth not act, is repugnant. But, it is no repugnancy to say
          that a perceiving thing should be the subject of ideas, or an
          active thing the cause of them. It is granted we have neither an
          immediate evidence nor a demonstrative knowledge of the existence
          of other finite spirits; but it will not thence follow that such
          spirits are on a foot with material substances: if to suppose the
          one be inconsistent, and it be not inconsistent to suppose the
          other; if the one can be inferred by no argument, and there is a
          probability for the other; if we see signs and effects indicating
          distinct finite agents like ourselves, and see no sign or symptom
          whatever that leads to a rational belief of Matter. I say, lastly,
          that I have a notion of Spirit, though I have not, strictly
          speaking, an idea of it<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href=

          not perceive it as an idea, or by means of an idea, but know it by
          reflexion.</p>

          Notwithstanding all you have said, to me it seems that, according
          to your own way of thinking, and in consequence of your own
          principles, it should follow that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></em> are
          only a system of floating ideas, without any substance to support
          them. Words are not to be used without a meaning. And, as there is
          no more meaning in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material

          How often must I repeat, that I know or am conscious of my own
          being; and that I <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          thinking, active principle that perceives, knows, wills, and
          operates about ideas. I know that I, one and the same self,
          perceive both colours and sounds: that a colour cannot perceive a
          sound, nor a sound a colour: that I am therefore one individual
          principle, distinct from colour and sound; and, for the same
          reason, from all other sensible things and inert ideas.

          the contrary, I know that nothing inconsistent can exist, and that
          the existence of Matter implies an inconsistency. Farther, I know
          what I mean when I affirm that there is a spiritual substance or
          support of ideas, that is, that a spirit knows and perceives ideas.
          But, I do not know what is meant when it is said that an
          unperceiving substance hath inherent in it and supports either
          ideas or the archetypes of ideas. There is therefore upon the whole
          no parity of case between Spirit and Matter.]</p>

          The same that I should myself, to wit, that it doth exist out of
          his mind. But then to a Christian it cannot surely be shocking to
          say, the real tree, existing without his mind, is truly known and
          comprehended by (that is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          God. Probably he may not at first glance be aware of the direct and
          immediate proof there is of this; inasmuch as the very being of a
          tree, or any other sensible thing, implies a mind wherein it is.
          But the point itself he cannot deny. The question between the
          Materialists and me is not, whether things have a <em class=

          existence out of the mind of this or that person<a id="noteref_872"

          whether they have an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          But, according to your notions, what difference is there between
          real things, and chimeras formed by the imagination, or the visions
          of a dream—since they are all equally in the mind<a id=
          "noteref_874" name="noteref_874" href="#note_874"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          The ideas formed by the imagination are faint and indistinct; they
          have, besides, an entire dependence on the will. But the ideas
          perceived by sense, that is, real things, are more vivid and clear;
          and, being imprinted on the mind by a spirit distinct from us, have
          not the like dependence on our will. There is therefore no danger
          of confounding these with the foregoing: and there is as little of
          confounding them with the visions of a dream, which are dim,
          irregular, and confused. And, though they should happen to be never
          so lively and natural, yet, by their not being connected, and of
          apiece with the preceding and subsequent transactions of our lives,
          they might easily be distinguished from realities. In short, by
          whatever method you distinguish <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>
          from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">chimeras</span></em> on your scheme, the same,
          it is evident, will hold also upon mine. For, it must be, I
          presume, by some perceived difference; and I am not for depriving
          you of any one thing that you perceive.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          But still, Philonous, you hold, there is nothing in <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the world but spirits and ideas. And
          this, you must needs acknowledge, sounds very oddly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          own the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em>, not being commonly used for
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">thing</span></em>, sounds something out of the
          way. My reason for using it was, because a necessary relation to
          the mind is understood to be implied by that term; and it is now
          commonly used by philosophers to denote the immediate objects of
          the understanding. But, however oddly the proposition may sound in
          words, yet it includes nothing so very strange or shocking in its
          sense; which in effect amounts to no more than this, to wit, that
          there are only things perceiving, and things perceived; or that
          every unthinking being is necessarily, and from the very nature of
          its existence, perceived by some mind; if not by a finite created
          mind, yet certainly by the infinite mind of God, in whom 'we live,
          and move, and have our being.' Is this as strange as to say, the
          sensible qualities are not on the objects: or that we cannot be
          sure of the existence of things, or know anything of their real
          natures—though we both see and feel them, and perceive them by all
          our senses?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          And, in consequence of this, must we not think there are no such
          things as physical or corporeal causes; but that a Spirit is the
          immediate cause of all the phenomena in nature? Can there be
          anything more extravagant than this?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Yes, it is infinitely more extravagant to say—a thing which is
          inert operates on the mind, and which is unperceiving is the cause
          of our perceptions, [<a id="noteref_875" name="noteref_875" href=
          "#note_875"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">875</span></span></a>without
          any regard either to consistency, or the old known axiom,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nothing
          can give to another that which it hath not itself</span></em>].
          Besides, that which to you, I know not for what reason, seems so
          extravagant is no more than the Holy Scriptures assert in a hundred
          places. In them God is represented as the sole and immediate Author
          of all those effects which some heathens and philosophers are wont
          to ascribe to Nature, Matter, Fate, or the like unthinking
          principle. This is so much the constant language of Scripture that
          it were needless to confirm it by citations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          You are not aware, Philonous, that, in making God <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the immediate Author of all the motions
          in nature, you make Him the Author of murder, sacrilege, adultery,
          and the like heinous sins.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          In answer to that, I observe, first, that the imputation of guilt
          is the same, whether a person commits an action with or without an
          instrument. In case therefore you suppose God to act by the
          mediation of an instrument, or occasion, called <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>,
          you as truly make Him the author of sin as I, who think Him the
          immediate agent in all those operations vulgarly ascribed to
          Nature. I farther observe that sin or moral turpitude doth not
          consist in the outward physical action or motion, but in the
          internal deviation of the will from the laws of reason and
          religion. This is plain, in that the killing an enemy in a battle,
          or putting a criminal legally to death, is not thought sinful;
          though the outward act be the very same with that in the case of
          murder. Since, therefore, sin doth not consist in the physical
          action, the making God an immediate cause of all such actions is
          not making Him the Author of sin. Lastly, I have nowhere said that
          God is the only agent who produces all the motions in bodies. It is
          true I have denied there are any other agents besides spirits; but
          this is very consistent with allowing to thinking rational beings,
          in the production of motions, the use of limited powers, ultimately
          indeed derived from God, but immediately under the direction of
          their own wills, which is sufficient to entitle them to all the
          guilt of their actions<a id="noteref_876" name="noteref_876" href=
          "#note_876"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          But the denying Matter, Philonous, or corporeal Substance; there is
          the point. You can never persuade me that this is not repugnant to
          the universal sense of mankind. Were our dispute to be determined
          by most voices, I am confident you would give up the point, without
          gathering the votes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          wish both our opinions were fairly stated and submitted to the
          judgment of men who had plain common sense, without the prejudices
          of a learned education. Let me be represented as one who trusts his
          senses, who thinks he knows the things he sees and feels, and
          entertains <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg
          455]</span><a name="Pg455" id="Pg455" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          no doubts of their existence; and you fairly set forth with all
          your doubts, your paradoxes, and your scepticism about you, and I
          shall willingly acquiesce in the determination of any indifferent
          person. That there is no substance wherein ideas can exist beside
          spirit is to me evident. And that the objects immediately perceived
          are ideas, is on all hands agreed<a id="noteref_877" name=

          that sensible qualities are objects immediately perceived no one
          can deny. It is therefore evident there can be no <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> of those qualities but
          spirit; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">in</span></em> which they exist, not by way of
          mode or property, but as a thing perceived in that which perceives
          it<a id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878" href=
          "#note_878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a>. I
          deny therefore that there is any unthinking <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> of the objects of
          sense, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">in that acceptation</span></em> that there is
          any material substance. But if by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          substance</span></em> is meant only <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensible
          body</span></em>—that which is seen and felt (and the
          unphilosophical part of the world, I dare say, mean no more)—then I
          am more certain of matter's existence than you or any other
          philosopher pretend to be. If there be anything which makes the
          generality of mankind averse from the notions I espouse: it is a
          misapprehension that I deny the reality of sensible things. But, as
          it is you who are guilty of that, and not I, it follows that in
          truth their aversion is against your notions and not mine. I do
          therefore assert that I am as certain as of my own being, that
          there are bodies or corporeal substances (meaning the things I
          perceive by my senses); and that, granting this, the bulk of
          mankind will take no thought about, nor think themselves at all
          concerned in the fate of those unknown natures, and philosophical
          quiddities, which some men are so fond of.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          What say you to this? Since, according to you, men judge of the
          reality of things by their senses, how can a man be mistaken in
          thinking the moon a plain lucid surface, about a foot in diameter;
          or a square tower, seen at a distance, round; or an oar, with one
          end in the water, crooked?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          He is not mistaken with regard to the ideas he actually perceives,
          but in the inferences he makes from <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page456">[pg 456]</span><a name="Pg456" id="Pg456" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> his present perceptions. Thus, in the case of
          the oar, what he immediately perceives by sight is certainly
          crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thence conclude
          that upon taking the oar out of the water he shall perceive the
          same crookedness; or that it would affect his touch as crooked
          things are wont to do: in that he is mistaken. In like manner, if
          he shall conclude from what he perceives in one station, that, in
          case he advances towards the moon or tower, he should still be
          affected with the like ideas, he is mistaken. But his mistake lies
          not in what he perceives immediately, and at present, (it being a
          manifest contradiction to suppose he should err in respect of that)
          but in the wrong judgment he makes concerning the ideas he
          apprehends to be connected with those immediately perceived: or,
          concerning the ideas that, from what he perceives at present, he
          imagines would be perceived in other circumstances. The case is the
          same with regard to the Copernican system. We do not here perceive
          any motion of the earth: but it were erroneous thence to conclude,
          that, in case we were placed at as great a distance from that as we
          are now from the other planets, we should not then perceive its
          motion<a id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879" href=

          understand you; and must needs own you say things plausible enough.
          But, give me leave to put you in mind of one thing. Pray,
          Philonous, were you not formerly as positive that Matter existed,
          as you are now that it does not?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          was. But here lies the difference. Before, my positiveness was
          founded, without examination, upon prejudice; but now, after
          inquiry, upon evidence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          After all, it seems our dispute is rather about words than things.
          We agree in the thing, but differ in the name. That we are affected
          with ideas <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">from without</span></em> is evident; and it is
          no less evident that there must be (I will not say archetypes, but)
          Powers without the mind<a id="noteref_880" name="noteref_880" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">880</span></span></a>,
          corresponding to those ideas. And, as these Powers cannot subsist
          by themselves, there is some subject of them necessarily to be
          admitted; which I call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, and you call <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirit</span></em>.
          This is all the difference.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Pray, Hylas, is that powerful Being, or subject of powers,
          extended?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It is therefore itself unextended?</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Is it not also active?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Without doubt. Otherwise, how could we attribute powers to it?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Now let me ask you two questions: <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em>,
          Whether it be agreeable to the usage either of philosophers or
          others to give the name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> to an unextended active
          being? And, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em>, Whether it be not
          ridiculously absurd to misapply names contrary to the common use of
          language?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Well then, let it not be called Matter, since you will have it so,
          but some <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Third Nature</span></em> distinct from Matter
          and Spirit. For what reason is there why you should call it Spirit?
          Does not the notion of spirit imply that it is thinking, as well as
          active and unextended?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          My reason is this: because I have a mind to have some notion of
          meaning in what I say: but I have no notion of any action distinct
          from volition, neither can I conceive volition to be anywhere but
          in a spirit: therefore, when I speak of an active being, I am
          obliged to mean a Spirit. Beside, what can be plainer than that a
          thing which hath no ideas in itself cannot impart them to me; and,
          if it hath ideas, surely it must be a Spirit. To make you
          comprehend the point still more clearly if it be possible. I assert
          as well as you that, since we are affected from without, we must
          allow Powers to be without, in a Being distinct from ourselves. So
          far we are agreed. But then we differ as to the kind of this
          powerful Being<a id="noteref_881" name="noteref_881" href=
          "#note_881"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">881</span></span></a>. I
          will have it to be Spirit, you Matter, or I know not what (I may
          add too, you know not what) Third Nature. Thus, I prove it to be
          Spirit. From the effects I see produced, I conclude there are
          actions; and, because <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg
          458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          actions, volitions; and, because there are volitions, there must be
          a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">will</span></em>. Again, the things I perceive
          must have an existence, they or their archetypes, out of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></em>
          mind: but, being ideas, neither they nor their archetypes can exist
          otherwise than in an understanding; there is therefore an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">understanding</span></em>. But will and
          understanding constitute in the strictest sense a mind or spirit.
          The powerful cause, therefore, of my ideas is in strict propriety
          of speech a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Spirit</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          And now I warrant you think you have made the point very clear,
          little suspecting that what you advance leads directly to a
          contradiction. Is it not an absurdity to imagine any imperfection
          in God?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Without a doubt.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> To

          It is.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Are we not sometimes affected with pain and uneasiness by some
          other Being?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          We are.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          And have you not said that Being is a Spirit, and is not that
          Spirit God?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I

          But you have asserted that whatever ideas we perceive from without
          are in the mind which affects us. The ideas, therefore, of pain and
          uneasiness are in God; or, in other words, God suffers pain: that
          is to say, there is an imperfection in the Divine nature: which,
          you acknowledged, was absurd. So you are caught in a plain
          contradiction<a id="noteref_882" name="noteref_882" href=
          "#note_882"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          That God knows or understands all things, and that He knows, among
          other things, what pain is, even every sort of painful sensation,
          and what it is for His creatures to suffer pain, I make no
          question. But, that God, though He knows and sometimes causes
          painful sensations in us, can Himself suffer pain, I positively
          deny. We, who are limited and dependent spirits, are liable to
          impressions of sense, the effects of an external Agent, which,
          being produced against our wills, are sometimes painful and uneasy.
          But God, whom no external <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg

          being can affect, who perceives nothing by sense as we do; whose
          will is absolute and independent, causing all things, and liable to
          be thwarted or resisted by nothing: it is evident, such a Being as
          this can suffer nothing, nor be affected with any painful
          sensation, or indeed any sensation at all. We are chained to a
          body: that is to say, our perceptions are connected with corporeal
          motions. By the law of our nature, we are affected upon every
          alteration in the nervous parts of our sensible body; which
          sensible body, rightly considered, is nothing but a complexion of
          such qualities or ideas as have no existence distinct from being
          perceived by a mind. So that this connexion of sensations with
          corporeal motions means no more than a correspondence in the order
          of nature, between two sets of ideas, or things immediately
          perceivable. But God is a Pure Spirit, disengaged from all such
          sympathy, or natural ties. No corporeal motions are attended with
          the sensations of pain or pleasure in His mind. To know everything
          knowable, is certainly a perfection; but to endure, or suffer, or
          feel anything by sense, is an imperfection. The former, I say,
          agrees to God, but not the latter. God knows, or hath ideas; but
          His ideas are not conveyed to Him by sense, as ours are. Your not
          distinguishing, where there is so manifest a difference, makes you
          fancy you see an absurdity where there is none.</p>

          But, all this while you have not considered that the quantity of
          Matter has been demonstrated to be proportioned to the gravity of
          bodies<a id="noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href=
          "#note_883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a>. And
          what can withstand demonstration?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Let me see how you demonstrate that point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          lay it down for a principle, that the moments or quantities of
          motion in bodies are in a direct compounded reason of the
          velocities and quantities of Matter contained in them. Hence, where
          the velocities are equal, it follows the moments are directly as
          the quantity of Matter in each. But it is found by experience that
          all bodies (bating the small inequalities, arising from the
          resistance of the air) descend with an equal velocity; the motion
          therefore of descending bodies, and consequently their gravity,
          which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name=
          "Pg460" id="Pg460" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is the cause or
          principle of that motion, is proportional to the quantity of
          Matter; which was to be demonstrated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          You lay it down as a self-evident principle that the quantity of
          motion in any body is proportional to the velocity and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>
          taken together; and this is made use of to prove a proposition from
          whence the existence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> is inferred. Pray is not
          this arguing in a circle?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> In
          the premise I only mean that the motion is proportional to the
          velocity, jointly with the extension and solidity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, allowing this to be true, yet it will not thence follow that
          gravity is proportional to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, in your philosophic sense
          of the word; except you take it for granted that unknown <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em>, or whatever else you
          call it, is proportional to those sensible qualities; which to
          suppose is plainly begging the question. That there is magnitude
          and solidity, or resistance, perceived by sense, I readily grant;
          as likewise, that gravity may be proportional to those qualities I
          will not dispute. But that either these qualities as perceived by
          us, or the powers producing them, do exist in a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          substratum</span></em>; this is what I deny, and you indeed affirm,
          but, notwithstanding your demonstration, have not yet proved.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          shall insist no longer on that point. Do you think, however, you
          shall persuade me the natural philosophers have been dreaming all
          this while? Pray what becomes of all their hypotheses and
          explications of the phenomena, which suppose the existence of
          Matter<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What mean you, Hylas, by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          mean the appearances which I perceive by my senses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          And the appearances perceived by sense, are they not ideas?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          have told you so a hundred times.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Therefore, to explain the phenomena is, to shew how we come to be
          affected with ideas, in that manner and<a id="noteref_885" name=
          "noteref_885" href="#note_885"><span class=

          wherein they are imprinted on our senses. Is it not?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg

          Now, if you can prove that any philosopher has explained the
          production of any one idea in our minds by the help of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em><a id="noteref_886" name=
          "noteref_886" href="#note_886"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a>, I
          shall for ever acquiesce, and look on all that hath been said
          against it as nothing; but, if you cannot, it is vain to urge the
          explication of phenomena. That a Being endowed with knowledge and
          will should produce or exhibit ideas is easily understood. But that
          a Being which is utterly destitute of these faculties should be
          able to produce ideas, or in any sort to affect an intelligence,
          this I can never understand. This I say, though we had some
          positive conception of Matter, though we knew its qualities, and
          could comprehend its existence, would yet be so far from explaining
          things, that it is itself the most inexplicable thing in the world.
          And yet, for all this, it will not follow that philosophers have
          been doing nothing; for, by observing and reasoning upon the
          connexion of ideas<a id="noteref_887" name="noteref_887" href=
          "#note_887"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">887</span></span></a>, they
          discover the laws and methods of nature, which is a part of
          knowledge both useful and entertaining.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          After all, can it be supposed God would deceive all mankind? Do you
          imagine He would have induced the whole world to believe the being
          of Matter, if there was no such thing?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          That every epidemical opinion, arising from prejudice, or passion,
          or thoughtlessness, may be imputed to God, as the Author of it, I
          believe you will not affirm. Whatsoever opinion we father on Him,
          it must be either because He has discovered it to us by
          supernatural revelation; or because it is so evident to our natural
          faculties, which were framed and given us by God, that it is
          impossible we should withhold our assent from it. But where is the
          revelation? or where is the evidence that extorts the belief of
          Matter? Nay, how does it appear, that Matter, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">taken for something
          distinct from what we perceive by our senses</span></em>, is
          thought to exist by all mankind; or, indeed, by any except a few
          philosophers, who do not know what <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page462">[pg 462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> they would be at? Your question supposes
          these points are clear; and, when you have cleared them, I shall
          think myself obliged to give you another answer. In the meantime,
          let it suffice that I tell you, I do not suppose God has deceived
          mankind at all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          But the novelty, Philonous, the novelty! There lies the danger. New
          notions should always be discountenanced; they unsettle men's
          minds, and nobody knows where they will end.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Why the rejecting a notion that has no foundation, either in sense,
          or in reason, or in Divine authority, should be thought to unsettle
          the belief of such opinions as are grounded on all or any of these,
          I cannot imagine. That innovations in government and religion are
          dangerous, and ought to be discountenanced, I freely own. But is
          there the like reason why they should be discouraged in philosophy?
          The making anything known which was unknown before is an innovation
          in knowledge: and, if all such innovations had been forbidden, men
          would have made a notable progress in the arts and sciences. But it
          is none of my business to plead for novelties and paradoxes. That
          the qualities we perceive are not on the objects: that we must not
          believe our senses: that we know nothing of the real nature of
          things, and can never be assured even of their existence: that real
          colours and sounds are nothing but certain unknown figures and
          motions: that motions are in themselves neither swift nor slow:
          that there are in bodies absolute extensions, without any
          particular magnitude or figure: that a thing stupid, thoughtless,
          and inactive, operates on a spirit: that the least particle of a
          body contains innumerable extended parts:—these are the novelties,
          these are the strange notions which shock the genuine uncorrupted
          judgment of all mankind; and being once admitted, embarrass the
          mind with endless doubts and difficulties. And it is against these
          and the like innovations I endeavour to vindicate Common Sense. It
          is true, in doing this, I may perhaps be obliged to use some
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ambages</span></span>, and ways of speech not
          common. But, if my notions are once thoroughly understood, that
          which is most singular in them will, in effect, be found to amount
          to no more than this:—that it is absolutely impossible, and a plain
          contradiction, to suppose <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg
          463]</span><a name="Pg463" id="Pg463" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          any unthinking Being should exist without being perceived by a
          Mind. And, if this notion be singular, it is a shame it should be
          so, at this time of day, and in a Christian country.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> As
          for the difficulties other opinions may be liable to, those are out
          of the question. It is your business to defend your own opinion.
          Can anything be plainer than that you are for changing all things
          into ideas? You, I say, who are not ashamed to charge me with
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">scepticism</span></em>. This is so plain,
          there is no denying it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          You mistake me. I am not for changing things into ideas, but rather
          ideas into things<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href=
          "#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a>;
          since those immediate objects of perception, which, according to
          you, are only appearances of things, I take to be the real things
          themselves<a id="noteref_889" name="noteref_889" href=
          "#note_889"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">889</span></span></a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Things! You may pretend what you please; but it is certain you
          leave us nothing but the empty forms of things, the outside only
          which strikes the senses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What you call the empty forms and outside of things seem to me the
          very things themselves. Nor are they empty or incomplete, otherwise
          than upon your supposition—that Matter<a id="noteref_890" name=
          "noteref_890" href="#note_890"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a> is an
          essential part of all corporeal things. We both, therefore, agree
          in this, that we perceive only sensible forms: but herein we
          differ—you will have them to be empty appearances, I real beings.
          In short, you do not trust your senses, I do.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          You say you believe your senses; and seem to applaud yourself that
          in this you agree with the vulgar. According to you, therefore, the
          true nature of a thing is discovered by the senses. If so, whence
          comes that disagreement? Why is not the same figure, and other
          sensible qualities, perceived all manner of ways? and why should we
          use a microscope the better to discover the true nature of a body,
          if it were discoverable to the naked eye?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Strictly speaking, Hylas, we do not see the same object that we
          feel<a id="noteref_891" name="noteref_891" href=
          "#note_891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a>;
          neither is the same object perceived <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464" id="Pg464" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> by the microscope which was by the naked
          eye<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href=
          "#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a>. But,
          in case every variation was thought sufficient to constitute a new
          kind or individual, the endless number or confusion of names would
          render language impracticable. Therefore, to avoid this, as well as
          other inconveniences which are obvious upon a little thought, men
          combine together several ideas, apprehended by divers senses, or by
          the same sense at different times, or in different circumstances,
          but observed, however, to have some connexion in nature, either
          with respect to co-existence or succession; all which they refer to
          one name, and consider as one thing. Hence it follows that when I
          examine, by my other senses, a thing I have seen, it is not in
          order to understand better the same object which I had perceived by
          sight, the object of one sense not being perceived by the other
          senses. And, when I look through a microscope, it is not that I may
          perceive more clearly what I perceived already with my bare eyes;
          the object perceived by the glass being quite different from the
          former. But, in both cases, my aim is only to know what ideas are
          connected together; and the more a man knows of the connexion of
          ideas<a id="noteref_893" name="noteref_893" href=
          "#note_893"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">893</span></span></a>, the
          more he is said to know of the nature of things. What, therefore,
          if our ideas are variable; what if our senses are not in all
          circumstances affected with the same appearances? It will not
          thence follow they are not to be trusted; or that they are
          inconsistent either with themselves or anything else: except it be
          with your preconceived notion of (I know not what) one single,
          unchanged, unperceivable, real Nature, marked by each name. Which
          prejudice seems to have taken its rise from not rightly
          understanding the common language of men, speaking of several
          distinct ideas as united into one thing by the mind. And, indeed,
          there is cause to suspect several erroneous conceits of the
          philosophers are owing to the same original: while they began to
          build their schemes not so much on notions as on words, which were
          framed by the vulgar, merely for conveniency and dispatch in the
          common actions of life, without any regard to speculation<a id=

          It is your opinion the ideas we perceive by our senses are not real
          things, but images or copies of them. Our knowledge, therefore, is
          no farther real than as our ideas are the true <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">representations</span></em> of those
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">originals</span></em>. But, as these supposed
          originals are in themselves unknown, it is impossible to know how
          far our ideas resemble them; or whether they resemble them at
          all<a id="noteref_895" name="noteref_895" href=
          "#note_895"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">895</span></span></a>. We
          cannot, therefore, be sure we have any real knowledge<a id=
          "noteref_896" name="noteref_896" href="#note_896"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">896</span></span></a>.
          Farther, as our ideas are perpetually varied, without any change in
          the supposed real things, it necessarily follows they cannot all be
          true copies of them: or, if some are and others are not, it is
          impossible to distinguish the former from the latter. And this
          plunges us yet deeper in uncertainty<a id="noteref_897" name=
          "noteref_897" href="#note_897"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">897</span></span></a>.
          Again, when we consider the point, we cannot conceive how any idea,
          or anything like an idea, should have an absolute existence out of
          a mind: nor consequently, according to you, how there should be any
          real thing in nature<a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href=
          "#note_898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a>. The
          result of all which is that we are thrown into the most hopeless
          and abandoned scepticism. Now, give me leave to ask you, First,
          Whether your referring ideas to certain absolutely existing
          unperceived substances, as their originals, be not the source of
          all this scepticism<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899" href=
          "#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">899</span></span></a>?
          Secondly, whether you are informed, either by sense or reason<a id=
          "noteref_900" name="noteref_900" href="#note_900"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">900</span></span></a>, of
          the existence of those unknown originals? And, in case <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg 466]</span><a name="Pg466" id="Pg466"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> you are not, whether it be not absurd
          to suppose them? Thirdly, Whether, upon inquiry, you find there is
          anything distinctly conceived or meant by the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute or
          external existence of unperceiving substances</span></em><a id=
          "noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href="#note_901"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a>?
          Lastly, Whether, the premises considered, it be not the wisest way
          to follow nature, trust your senses, and, laying aside all anxious
          thought about unknown natures or substances<a id="noteref_902"
          name="noteref_902" href="#note_902"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">902</span></span></a>,
          admit with the vulgar those for real things which are perceived by
          the senses?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          For the present, I have no inclination to the answering part. I
          would much rather see how you can get over what follows. Pray are
          not the objects perceived by the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">senses</span></em>
          of one, likewise perceivable to others present? If there were a
          hundred more here, they would all see the garden, the trees, and
          flowers, as I see them. But they are not in the same manner
          affected with the ideas I frame in my <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">imagination</span></em>. Does not this make a
          difference between the former sort of objects and the latter?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          grant it does. Nor have I ever denied a difference between the
          objects of sense and those of imagination<a id="noteref_903" name=
          "noteref_903" href="#note_903"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a>. But
          what would you infer from thence? You cannot say that sensible
          objects exist unperceived, because they are perceived by many.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          own I can make nothing of that objection: but it hath led me into
          another. Is it not your opinion that by our senses we perceive only
          the ideas existing in our minds?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          It is.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          But the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">same</span></em> idea which is in my mind
          cannot be in yours, or in any other mind. Doth it not therefore
          follow, from your principles, that no two can see the same
          thing<a id="noteref_904" name="noteref_904" href=
          "#note_904"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">904</span></span></a>? And
          is not this highly absurd?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          If the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">same</span></em> be taken in the vulgar
          acceptation, it is certain (and not at all repugnant to the
          principles <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467">[pg
          467]</span><a name="Pg467" id="Pg467" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> I
          maintain) that different persons may perceive the same thing; or
          the same thing or idea exist in different minds. Words are of
          arbitrary imposition; and, since men are used to apply the word
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">same</span></em> where no distinction or
          variety is perceived, and I do not pretend to alter their
          perceptions, it follows that, as men have said before, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">several saw the
          same thing</span></em>, so they may, upon like occasions, still
          continue to use the same phrase, without any deviation either from
          propriety of language, or the truth of things. But, if the term
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">same</span></em> be used in the acceptation of
          philosophers, who pretend to an abstracted notion of identity,
          then, according to their sundry definitions of this notion (for it
          is not yet agreed wherein that philosophic identity consists), it
          may or may not be possible for divers persons to perceive the same
          thing<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href=
          "#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a>. But
          whether philosophers shall think fit to <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">call</span></em> a
          thing the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">same</span></em> or no, is, I conceive, of
          small importance. Let us suppose several men together, all endued
          with the same faculties, and consequently affected in like sort by
          their senses, and who had yet never known the use of language; they
          would, without question, agree in their perceptions. Though
          perhaps, when they came to the use of speech, some regarding the
          uniformness of what was perceived, might call it the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same</span></em>
          thing: others, especially regarding the diversity of persons who
          perceived, might choose the denomination of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">different</span></em> things. But who sees not
          that all the dispute is about a word? to wit, whether what is
          perceived by different persons may yet have the term <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">same</span></em>
          applied to it<a id="noteref_906" name="noteref_906" href=
          "#note_906"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">906</span></span></a>? Or,
          suppose a house, whose walls or outward shell remaining unaltered,
          the chambers are all pulled down, and new ones built in their
          place; and that you should call this the <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">same</span></em>, and I should say it was not
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">same</span></em> house:—would we not, for all
          this, perfectly agree in our thoughts of the house, considered in
          itself? And would not all the difference consist in a sound? If you
          should say, We differed in our notions; for that you superadded to
          your idea of the house the simple abstracted idea of identity,
          whereas I did not; I would tell you, I know not what you mean by
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstracted idea of identity</span></em>; and
          should desire you to look into your own thoughts, and be sure you
          understood yourself.——Why so silent, Hylas? Are you not yet
          satisfied men may dispute about identity and diversity, without any
          real difference in their thoughts and opinions, abstracted from
          names? Take this farther reflexion with you—that whether Matter be
          allowed to exist or no, the case is exactly the same as to the
          point in hand. For the Materialists themselves acknowledge what we
          immediately perceive by our senses to be our own ideas. Your
          difficulty, therefore, that no two see the same thing, makes
          equally against the Materialists and me.</p>

          Philonous, when I consider the substance of what you advance
          against <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          than this:—We are sure that we really see, hear, feel; in a word,
          that we are affected with sensible impressions.</p>

          And how are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">we</span></em> concerned any farther? I see
          this cherry, I feel it, I taste it: and I am sure <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>
          cannot be seen, or felt, or tasted: it is therefore <em class=

          Take away the sensations of softness, moisture, redness, tartness,
          and you take away the cherry, since it is not a being distinct from
          sensations. A cherry, I say, is nothing but a congeries of sensible
          impressions, or ideas perceived by various senses: which ideas are
          united into one thing (or have one name given them) by the mind,
          because they are observed to attend each other. Thus, when the
          palate is affected with such a particular taste, the sight is
          affected with a red colour, the touch with roundness, softness,
          &amp;c. Hence, when I see, and feel, and taste, in such sundry
          certain manners, I am sure the cherry exists, or is real; its
          reality being in my opinion nothing abstracted from those
          sensations. But if by the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cherry</span></em>
          you mean an unknown nature, distinct from all those sensible
          qualities, and by its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">existence</span></em> something distinct from

          Explain to me now, O Philonous! how it is possible there should be
          room for all those trees and houses to exist in your mind. Can
          extended things be contained in that which is unextended? Or, are
          we to imagine impressions made on a thing void of all solidity? You
          cannot say objects are in your mind, as books in your study: or
          that things are imprinted on it, as the figure of a seal upon wax.
          In what sense, therefore, are we to understand those expressions?
          Explain me this if you can: and I shall then be able to answer all
          those queries you formerly put to me about my <em class=

          Look you, Hylas, when I speak of objects as existing in the mind,
          or imprinted on the senses, I would not be understood in the gross
          literal sense; as when bodies are said to exist in a place, or a
          seal to make an impression upon wax. My meaning is only that the
          mind comprehends or perceives them; and that it is affected from
          without, or by some being distinct from itself<a id="noteref_909"
          name="noteref_909" href="#note_909"><span class=

          is my explication of your difficulty; and how it can serve to make
          your tenet of an unperceiving material <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em> intelligible, I would
          fain know.</p>

          Nay, if that be all, I confess I do not see what use can be made of
          it. But are you not guilty of some abuse of language in this?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          None at all. It is no more than common custom, which you know is
          the rule of language, hath authorised: nothing being more usual,
          than for philosophers to speak of the immediate objects of the
          understanding as things existing in the mind. Nor is there anything
          in this but what is conformable to the general analogy of language;
          most part of the mental operations being signified by words
          borrowed from sensible things; as is plain in the terms <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          You have, I own, satisfied me in this point. But there still
          remains one great difficulty, which I know not how you will get
          over. And, indeed, it is of such importance <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that if you could solve all others,

          Let me know this mighty difficulty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          The Scripture account of the creation is what appears to me utterly
          irreconcilable with your notions<a id="noteref_910" name=

          Moses tells us of a creation: a creation of what? of ideas? No,
          certainly, but of things, of real things, solid corporeal
          substances. Bring your principles to agree with this, and I shall
          perhaps agree with you.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Moses mentions the sun, moon, and stars, earth and sea, plants and
          animals. That all these do really exist, and were in the beginning
          created by God, I make no question. If by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>
          you mean fictions and fancies of the mind<a id="noteref_911" name=
          "noteref_911" href="#note_911"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">911</span></span></a>, then
          these are no ideas. If by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em> you mean immediate objects
          of the understanding, or sensible things, which cannot exist
          unperceived, or out of a mind<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912"
          href="#note_912"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a>, then
          these things are ideas. But whether you do or do not call them
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>, it matters little. The
          difference is only about a name. And, whether that name be retained
          or rejected, the sense, the truth, and reality of things continues
          the same. In common talk, the objects of our senses are not termed
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>, but <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things</span></em>.
          Call them so still: provided you do not attribute to them any
          absolute external existence, and I shall never quarrel with you for
          a word. The creation, therefore, I allow to have been a creation of
          things, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">real</span></em> things. Neither is this in
          the least inconsistent with my principles, as is evident from what
          I have now said; and would have been evident to you without this,
          if you had not forgotten what had been so often said before. But as
          for solid corporeal substances, I desire you to shew where Moses
          makes any mention of them; and, if they should be mentioned by him,
          or any other inspired writer, it would still be incumbent on you to
          shew those words were not taken in the vulgar acceptation, for
          things falling under our senses, but in the philosophic<a id=
          "noteref_913" name="noteref_913" href="#note_913"><span class=

          acceptation, for Matter, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          with an absolute existence</span></em>. When you have proved these
          points, then (and not till then) may you bring the authority of
          Moses into our dispute.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> It
          is in vain to dispute about a point so clear. I am content to refer
          it to your own conscience. Are you not satisfied there is some
          peculiar repugnancy between the Mosaic account of the creation and
          your notions?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          If all possible sense which can be put on the first chapter of
          Genesis may be conceived as consistently with my principles as any
          other, then it has no peculiar repugnancy with them. But there is
          no sense you may not as well conceive, believing as I do. Since,
          besides spirits, all you conceive are ideas; and the existence of
          these I do not deny. Neither do you pretend they exist without the
          mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Pray let me see any sense you can understand it in.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Why, I imagine that if I had been present at the creation, I should
          have seen things produced into being—that is become perceptible—in
          the order prescribed by the sacred historian. I ever before
          believed the Mosaic account of the creation, and now find no
          alteration in my manner of believing it. When things are said to
          begin or end their existence, we do not mean this with regard to
          God, but His creatures. All objects are eternally known by God, or,
          which is the same thing, have an eternal existence in His mind: but
          when things, before imperceptible to creatures, are, by a decree of
          God, perceptible to them, then are they said to begin a relative
          existence, with respect to created minds. Upon reading therefore
          the Mosaic account of the creation, I understand that the several
          parts of the world became gradually perceivable to finite spirits,
          endowed with proper faculties; so that, whoever such were present,
          they were in truth perceived by them<a id="noteref_914" name=
          "noteref_914" href="#note_914"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a>. This
          is the literal obvious sense <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page473">[pg 473]</span><a name="Pg473" id="Pg473" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> suggested to me by the words of the Holy
          Scripture: in which is included no mention, or no thought, either
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em>, instrument, occasion,
          or absolute existence. And, upon inquiry, I doubt not it will be
          found that most plain honest men, who believe the creation, never
          think of those things any more than I. What metaphysical sense you
          may understand it in, you only can tell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          But, Philonous, you do not seem to be aware that you allow created
          things, in the beginning, only a relative, and consequently
          hypothetical being: that is to say, upon supposition there were
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">men</span></em> to perceive them; without
          which they have no actuality of absolute existence, wherein
          creation might terminate. Is it not, therefore, according to you,
          plainly impossible the creation of any inanimate creatures should
          precede that of man? And is not this directly contrary to the
          Mosaic account?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          In answer to that, I say, first, created beings might begin to
          exist in the mind of other created intelligences, beside men. You
          will not therefore be able to prove any contradiction between Moses
          and my notions, unless you first shew there was no other order of
          finite created spirits in being, before man. I say farther, in case
          we conceive the creation, as we should at this time, a parcel of
          plants or vegetables of all sorts produced, by an invisible Power,
          in a desert where nobody was present—that this way of explaining or
          conceiving it is consistent with my principles, since they deprive
          you of nothing, either sensible or imaginable; that it exactly
          suits with the common, natural, and undebauched notions of mankind;
          that it manifests the dependence of all things on God; and
          consequently hath all the good effect or influence, which it is
          possible that important article of our faith should have in making
          men humble, thankful, and resigned to their [<a id="noteref_915"
          name="noteref_915" href="#note_915"><span class=

          Creator. I say, moreover, that, in this naked conception of things,
          divested of words, there will not be found any notion of what you
          call the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">actuality of absolute existence</span></em>.
          You may indeed raise a dust with those terms, and so lengthen our
          dispute to no purpose. But I entreat you calmly to look into your
          own thoughts, and then tell me if they are not a useless and
          unintelligible jargon.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474">[pg

          own I have no very clear notion annexed to them. But what say you
          to this? Do you not make the existence of sensible things consist
          in their being in a mind? And were not all things eternally in the
          mind of God? Did they not therefore exist from all eternity,

          May we not understand it to have been entirely in respect of finite
          spirits; so that things, with regard to us, may properly be said to
          begin their existence, or be created, when God decreed they should
          become perceptible to intelligent creatures, in that order and
          manner which He then established, and we now call the laws of
          nature? You may call this a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">relative</span></em>, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hypothetical
          existence</span></em> if you please. But, so long as it supplies us
          with the most natural, obvious, and literal sense of the Mosaic
          history of the creation; so long as it answers all the religious
          ends of that great article; in a word, so long as you can assign no
          other sense or meaning in its stead; why should we reject this? Is
          it to comply with a ridiculous sceptical humour of making
          everything nonsense and unintelligible? I am sure you cannot say it
          is for the glory of God. For, allowing it to be a thing possible
          and conceivable that the corporeal world should have an absolute
          existence extrinsical to the mind of God, as well as to the minds
          of all created spirits; yet how could this set forth either the
          immensity or omniscience of the Deity, or the necessary and
          immediate dependence of all things on Him? Nay, would it not rather
          seem to derogate from those attributes?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Well, but as to this decree of God's, for making things
          perceptible, what say you, Philonous? Is it not <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a name="Pg475" id="Pg475"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> plain, God did either execute that
          decree from all eternity, or at some certain time began to will
          what He had not actually willed before, but only designed to will?
          If the former, then there could be no creation, or beginning of
          existence, in finite things<a id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916"
          href="#note_916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">916</span></span></a>. If
          the latter, then we must acknowledge something new to befall the
          Deity; which implies a sort of change: and all change argues
          imperfection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          Pray consider what you are doing. Is it not evident this objection
          concludes equally against a creation in any sense; nay, against
          every other act of the Deity, discoverable by the light of nature?
          None of which can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">we</span></em> conceive, otherwise than as
          performed in time, and having a beginning. God is a Being of
          transcendent and unlimited perfections: His nature, therefore, is
          incomprehensible to finite spirits. It is not, therefore, to be
          expected, that any man, whether Materialist or Immaterialist,
          should have exactly just notions of the Deity, His attributes, and
          ways of operation. If then you would infer anything against me,
          your difficulty must not be drawn from the inadequateness of our
          conceptions of the Divine nature, which is unavoidable on any
          scheme; but from the denial of Matter, of which there is not one
          word, directly or indirectly, in what you have now objected.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          must acknowledge the difficulties you are concerned to clear are
          such only as arise from the non-existence of Matter, and are
          peculiar to that notion. So far you are in the right. But I cannot
          by any means bring myself to think there is no such peculiar
          repugnancy between the creation and your opinion; though indeed
          where to fix it, I do not distinctly know.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          What would you have? Do I not acknowledge a twofold state of
          things—the one ectypal or natural, the other archetypal and
          eternal? The former was created in time; the latter existed from
          everlasting in the mind of God<a id="noteref_917" name=
          "noteref_917" href="#note_917"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">917</span></span></a>. Is
          not this agreeable to the common notions of divines? or, is any
          more than this necessary in order to conceive the creation? But you
          suspect some peculiar <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg
          476]</span><a name="Pg476" id="Pg476" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          repugnancy, though you know not where it lies. To take away all
          possibility of scruple in the case, do but consider this one point.
          Either you are not able to conceive the creation on any hypothesis
          whatsoever; and, if so, there is no ground for dislike or complaint
          against any particular opinion on that score: or you are able to
          conceive it; and, if so, why not on my Principles, since thereby
          nothing conceivable is taken away? You have all along been allowed
          the full scope of sense, imagination, and reason. Whatever,
          therefore, you could before apprehend, either immediately or
          mediately by your senses, or by ratiocination from your senses;
          whatever you could perceive, imagine, or understand, remains still
          with you. If, therefore, the notion you have of the creation by
          other Principles be intelligible, you have it still upon mine; if
          it be not intelligible, I conceive it to be no notion at all; and
          so there is no loss of it. And indeed it seems to me very plain
          that the supposition of Matter, that is a thing perfectly unknown
          and inconceivable, cannot serve to make us conceive anything. And,
          I hope it need not be proved to you that if the existence of
          Matter<a id="noteref_918" name="noteref_918" href=
          "#note_918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">918</span></span></a> doth
          not make the creation conceivable, the creation's being without it
          inconceivable can be no objection against its non-existence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          confess, Philonous, you have almost satisfied me in this point of
          the creation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          would fain know why you are not quite satisfied. You tell me indeed
          of a repugnancy between the Mosaic history and Immaterialism: but
          you know not where it lies. Is this reasonable, Hylas? Can you
          expect I should solve a difficulty without knowing what it is? But,
          to pass by all that, would not a man think you were assured there
          is no repugnancy between the received notions of Materialists and
          the inspired writings?</p>

          The creation, therefore, according to them, was not the creation of
          things sensible, which have only a relative being, but of certain
          unknown natures, which have an absolute being, wherein creation
          might terminate?</p>

          Is it not therefore evident the assertors of Matter destroy the
          plain obvious sense of Moses, with which their notions are utterly
          inconsistent; and instead of it obtrude on us I know not what;
          something equally unintelligible to themselves and me?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Moses tells us of a creation. A creation of what? of unknown
          quiddities, of occasions, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">substratum</span></em>? No, certainly; but of
          things obvious to the senses. You must first reconcile this with
          your notions, if you expect I should be reconciled to them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I

          Then as to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">absolute existence</span></em>; was there ever
          known a more jejune notion than that? Something it is so abstracted
          and unintelligible that you have frankly owned you could not
          conceive it, much less explain anything by it. But allowing Matter
          to exist, and the notion of absolute existence to be as clear as
          light; yet, was this ever known to make the creation more credible?
          Nay, hath it not furnished the atheists and infidels of all ages
          with the most plausible arguments against a creation? That a
          corporeal substance, which hath an absolute existence without the
          minds of spirits, should be produced out of nothing, by the mere
          will of a Spirit, hath been looked upon as a thing so contrary to
          all reason, so impossible and absurd, that not only the most
          celebrated among the ancients, but even divers modern and Christian
          philosophers have thought Matter co-eternal with the Deity<a id=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          own, Philonous, I think it does not. This of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">creation</span></em> is the last objection I
          can think of; and I must needs own it hath been sufficiently
          answered as well as the rest. Nothing now remains to be overcome
          but a sort of unaccountable backwardness that I find in myself
          towards your notions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          When a man is swayed, he knows not why, to one side of the
          question, can this, think you, be anything else but the effect of
          prejudice, which never fails to attend old and rooted notions? And
          indeed in this respect I cannot deny the belief of Matter to have
          very much the advantage over the contrary opinion, with men of a
          learned education.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I

          As a balance, therefore, to this weight of prejudice, let us throw
          into the scale the great advantages<a id="noteref_920" name=
          "noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a> that
          arise from the belief of Immaterialism, both in regard to religion
          and human learning. The being of a God, and incorruptibility of the
          soul, those great articles of religion, are they not proved with
          the clearest and most immediate evidence? When I say the being of a
          God, I do not mean an obscure general Cause of things, whereof we
          have no conception, but God, in the strict and proper sense of the
          word. A Being whose spirituality, omnipresence, providence,
          omniscience, infinite power and goodness, are as conspicuous as the
          existence of sensible things, of which (notwithstanding the
          fallacious pretences and affected scruples of Sceptics) there is no
          more reason to doubt than of our own being.—Then, with relation to
          human sciences. In Natural Philosophy, what intricacies, what
          obscurities, what contradictions hath the belief of Matter led men
          into! To say nothing of the numberless disputes about its extent,
          continuity, homogeneity, gravity, divisibility, &amp;c.—do they not
          pretend to explain all things by bodies operating on bodies,
          according to the laws of motion? and yet, are they able to
          comprehend how one body should move another? Nay, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page479">[pg 479]</span><a name="Pg479" id="Pg479"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> admitting there was no difficulty in
          reconciling the notion of an inert being with a cause, or in
          conceiving how an accident might pass from one body to another;
          yet, by all their strained thoughts and extravagant suppositions,
          have they been able to reach the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mechanical</span></em> production of any one
          animal or vegetable body? Can they account, by the laws of motion,
          for sounds, tastes, smells, or colours; or for the regular course
          of things? Have they accounted, by physical principles, for the
          aptitude and contrivance even of the most inconsiderable parts of
          the universe? But, laying aside Matter and corporeal causes, and
          admitting only the efficiency of an All-perfect Mind, are not all
          the effects of nature easy and intelligible? If the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">phenomena</span></em> are nothing else but
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ideas</span></em>; God is a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spirit</span></em>,
          but Matter an unintelligent, unperceiving being. If they
          demonstrate an unlimited power in their cause; God is active and
          omnipotent, but Matter an inert mass. If the order, regularity, and
          usefulness of them can never be sufficiently admired; God is
          infinitely wise and provident, but Matter destitute of all
          contrivance and design. These surely are great advantages in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Physics</span></em>. Not to mention that the
          apprehension of a distant Deity naturally disposes men to a
          negligence in their moral actions; which they would be more
          cautious of, in case they thought Him immediately present, and
          acting on their minds, without the interposition of Matter, or
          unthinking second causes.—Then in <em class=

          substance and accident, principle of individuation, possibility of
          Matter's thinking, origin of ideas, the manner how two independent
          substances so widely different as <em class=

          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, should mutually operate on
          each other? what difficulties, I say, and endless disquisitions,
          concerning these and innumerable other the like points, do we
          escape, by supposing only Spirits and ideas?—Even the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Mathematics</span></em> themselves, if we take
          away the absolute existence of extended things, become much more
          clear and easy; the most shocking paradoxes and intricate
          speculations in those sciences depending on the infinite
          divisibility of finite <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg
          480]</span><a name="Pg480" id="Pg480" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          extension; which depends on that supposition.—But what need is
          there to insist on the particular sciences? Is not that opposition
          to all science whatsoever, that frenzy of the ancient and modern
          Sceptics, built on the same foundation? Or can you produce so much
          as one argument against the reality of corporeal things, or in
          behalf of that avowed utter ignorance of their natures, which doth
          not suppose their reality to consist in an external absolute
          existence? Upon this supposition, indeed, the objections from the
          change of colours in a pigeon's neck, or the appearance of the
          broken oar in the water, must be allowed to have weight. But these
          and the like objections vanish, if we do not maintain the being of
          absolute external originals, but place the reality of things in
          ideas, fleeting indeed, and changeable;—however, not changed at
          random, but according to the fixed order of nature. For, herein
          consists that constancy and truth of things which secures all the
          concerns of life, and distinguishes that which is <em class=

          agree to all you have now said, and must own that nothing can
          incline me to embrace your opinion more than the advantages I see
          it is attended with. I am by nature lazy; and this would be a
          mighty abridgment in knowledge. What doubts, what hypotheses, what
          labyrinths of amusement, what fields of disputation, what an ocean
          of false learning, may be avoided by that single notion of

          After all, is there anything farther remaining to be done? You may
          remember you promised to embrace that opinion which upon
          examination should appear most agreeable to Common Sense and remote
          from Scepticism. This, by your own confession, is that which denies
          Matter, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          things. Nor is this all; the same notion has been proved several
          ways, viewed in different lights, pursued in its consequences, and
          all objections against it cleared. Can there be a greater evidence
          of its truth? or is it possible it should have all the marks of a

          Pray, Hylas, do you in other cases, when a point is once evidently
          proved, withhold your consent on account of objections or
          difficulties it may be liable to? Are the difficulties that attend
          the doctrine of incommensurable quantities, of the angle of
          contact, of the asymptotes to curves, or the like, sufficient to
          make you hold out against mathematical demonstration? Or will you
          disbelieve the Providence of God, because there may be some
          particular things which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">you</span></em> know not how to reconcile with
          it? If there are difficulties attending <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Immaterialism</span></em>, there are at the
          same time direct and evident proofs of it. But for the existence of
          Matter<a id="noteref_923" name="noteref_923" href=
          "#note_923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          is not one proof, and far more numerous and insurmountable
          objections lie against it. But where are those mighty difficulties
          you insist on? Alas! you know not where or what they are; something
          which may possibly occur hereafter. If this be a sufficient
          pretence for withholding your full assent, you should never yield
          it to any proposition, how free soever from exceptions, how clearly
          and solidly soever demonstrated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          You have satisfied me, Philonous.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          But, to arm you against all future objections, do but consider:
          That which bears equally hard on two contradictory opinions can be
          proof against neither. Whenever, therefore, any difficulty occurs,
          try if you can find a solution for it on the hypothesis of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Materialists</span></em>. Be not deceived by
          words; but sound your own thoughts. And in case you cannot conceive
          it easier by the help of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Materialism</span></em>, it is plain it can be
          no objection against <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Immaterialism</span></em>. Had you proceeded
          all along by this rule, you would probably have spared yourself
          abundance of trouble in objecting; since of all your difficulties I
          challenge you to shew one that is explained by Matter: nay, which
          is not more unintelligible with than without that supposition; and
          consequently makes rather <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">against</span></em> than <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em> it.
          You should consider, in each <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page482">[pg 482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> particular, whether the difficulty arises
          from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">non-existence of Matter</span></em>. If it
          doth not, you might as well argue from the infinite divisibility of
          extension against the Divine prescience, as from such a difficulty
          against <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Immaterialism</span></em>. And yet, upon
          recollection, I believe you will find this to have been often, if
          not always, the case. You should likewise take heed not to argue on
          a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">petitio
          principii</span></span>. One is apt to say—The unknown substances
          ought to be esteemed real things, rather than the ideas in our
          minds: and who can tell but the unthinking external substance may
          concur, as a cause or instrument, in the productions of our ideas?
          But is not this proceeding on a supposition that there are such
          external substances? And to suppose this, is it not begging the
          question? But, above all things, you should beware of imposing on
          yourself by that vulgar sophism which is called <span lang="la"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ignoratio clenchi</span></span>. You talked
          often as if you thought I maintained the non-existence of Sensible
          Things. Whereas in truth no one can be more thoroughly assured of
          their existence than I am. And it is you who doubt; I should have
          said, positively deny it. Everything that is seen, felt, heard, or
          any way perceived by the senses, is, on the principles I embrace, a
          real being; but not on yours. Remember, the Matter you contend for
          is an Unknown Somewhat (if indeed it may be termed <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">somewhat</span></em>), which is quite stripped
          of all sensible qualities, and can neither be perceived by sense,
          nor apprehended by the mind. Remember, I say, that it is not any
          object which is hard or soft, hot or cold, blue or white, round or
          square, &amp;c. For all these things I affirm do exist. Though
          indeed I deny they have an existence distinct from being perceived;
          or that they exist out of all minds whatsoever. Think on these
          points; let them be attentively considered and still kept in view.
          Otherwise you will not comprehend the state of the question;
          without which your objections will always be wide of the mark, and,
          instead of mine, may possibly be directed (as more than once they
          have been) against your own notions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          must needs own, Philonous, nothing seems to have kept me from
          agreeing with you more than this same <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mistaking the
          question</span></em>. In denying Matter, at first glimpse I am
          tempted to imagine you deny the things <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page483">[pg 483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> we see and feel: but, upon reflexion, find
          there is no ground for it. What think you, therefore, of retaining
          the name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, and applying it to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensible
          things</span></em>? This may be done without any change in your
          sentiments: and, believe me, it would be a means of reconciling
          them to some persons who may be more shocked at an innovation in
          words than in opinion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span>
          With all my heart: retain the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Matter,</span></em>
          and apply it to the objects of sense, if you please; provided you
          do not attribute to them any subsistence distinct from their being
          perceived. I shall never quarrel with you for an expression.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material
          substance</span></em>, are terms introduced by philosophers; and,
          as used by them, imply a sort of independency, or a subsistence
          distinct from being perceived by a mind: but are never used by
          common people; or, if ever, it is to signify the immediate objects
          of sense. One would think, therefore, so long as the names of all
          particular things, with the terms <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sensible</span></em>, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">stuff</span></em>, and the like, are retained,
          the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> should be never missed in
          common talk. And in philosophical discourses it seems the best way
          to leave it quite out: since there is not, perhaps, any one thing
          that hath more favoured and strengthened the depraved bent of the
          mind towards Atheism than the use of that general confused
          term.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span>
          Well but, Philonous, since I am content to give up the notion of an
          unthinking substance exterior to the mind, I think you ought not to
          deny me the privilege of using the word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>
          as I please, and annexing it to a collection of sensible qualities
          subsisting only in the mind. I freely own there is no other
          substance, in a strict sense, than <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirit</span></em>.
          But I have been so long accustomed to the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">term
          Matter</span></em> that I know not how to part with it: to say,
          there is no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> in the world, is still
          shocking to me. Whereas to say—There is no <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>,
          if by that term be meant an unthinking substance existing without
          the mind; but if by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> is meant some sensible
          thing, whose existence consists in being perceived, then there is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>:—this distinction gives it
          quite another turn; and men will come into your notions with small
          difficulty, when they are proposed in that manner. For, after all,
          the controversy about <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Matter</span></em> in the strict acceptation
          of it, lies altogether <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg
          484]</span><a name="Pg484" id="Pg484" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          between you and the philosophers: whose principles, I acknowledge,
          are not near so natural, or so agreeable to the common sense of
          mankind, and Holy Scripture, as yours. There is nothing we either
          desire or shun but as it makes, or is apprehended to make, some
          part of our happiness or misery. But what hath happiness or misery,
          joy or grief, pleasure or pain, to do with Absolute Existence; or
          with unknown entities, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">abstracted from all relation to
          us</span></em>? It is evident, things regard us only as they are
          pleasing or displeasing: and they can please or displease only so
          far forth as they are perceived. Farther, therefore, we are not
          concerned; and thus far you leave things as you found them. Yet
          still there is something new in this doctrine. It is plain, I do
          not now think with the philosophers; nor yet altogether with the
          vulgar. I would know how the case stands in that respect;
          precisely, what you have added to, or altered in my former
          notions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phil.</span></span> I
          do not pretend to be a setter-up of new notions. My endeavours tend
          only to unite, and place in a clearer light, that truth which was
          before shared between the vulgar and the philosophers:—the former
          being of opinion, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">those things they immediately perceive are the
          real things</span></em>; and the latter, that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the things
          immediately perceived are ideas, which exist only in the
          mind</span></em><a id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a>.
          Which two notions put together, do, in effect, constitute the
          substance of what I advance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyl.</span></span> I
          have been a long time distrusting my senses: methought I saw things
          by a dim light and through false glasses. Now the glasses are
          removed and a new light breaks in upon my understanding. I am
          clearly convinced that I see things in their native forms, and am
          no longer in pain about their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unknown natures</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute
          existence</span></em>. This is the state I find myself in at
          present; though, indeed, the course that brought me to it I do not
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg 485]</span><a name=
          "Pg485" id="Pg485" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> yet thoroughly
          comprehend. You set out upon the same principles that Academics,
          Cartesians, and the like sects usually do; and for a long time it
          looked as if you were advancing their philosophical Scepticism:
          but, in the end, your conclusions are directly opposite to
          theirs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          You see, Hylas, the water of yonder fountain, how it is forced
          upwards, in a round column, to a certain height; at which it
          breaks, and falls back into the basin from whence it rose: its
          ascent, as well as descent, proceeding from the same uniform law or
          principle of gravitation. Just so, the same Principles which, at
          first view, lead to Scepticism, pursued to a certain point, bring
          men back to Common Sense.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Latin
          dissertation on Motion, or change of place in the component atoms
          of the material world, was written in 1720, when Berkeley was
          returning to Ireland, after he had spent some years in Italy, on
          leave of absence from Trinity College. A prize for an essay on the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Cause of Motion,”</span> had, it seems,
          been offered in that year by the Paris Academy of Sciences. The
          subject suggested an advance on the line of thought pursued in
          Berkeley's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Principles</span></span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span>. The mind-dependent
          reality of the material world, prominent in those works, was in
          them insisted on, not as a speculative paradox, but mainly in order
          to shew the spiritual character of the Power that is continually at
          work throughout the universe. This essay on what was thus a
          congenial subject was finished at Lyons, and published early in
          1721, soon after Berkeley arrived in London. It was reprinted in
          his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Miscellany</span></span> in 1752. I have not
          found evidence that it was ever submitted to the French Academy. At
          any rate the prize was awarded to Crousaz, the well-known logician
          and professor of philosophy at Lausanne.</p><span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Motu</span></span>
          is interesting biographically as well as philosophically, as a
          revelation of Berkeley's way of thinking about the causal relations
          of Matter and Spirit seven years after the publication of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span>. In 1713 his
          experience of life was confined to Ireland. Now, after months in
          London, in the society of Swift, and Pope, and Addison, he had
          observed nature and men in France and Italy. His eager temperament
          and extraordinary social charm opened the way in those years of
          travel to frequent intercourse with famous men. This, for the time,
          superseded controversy with materialism and scepticism, and
          diverted his enthusiasm to nature and high art. One likes to see
          how he handles the old questions as they now arise in the
          philosophical treatment of motion in space, which was regarded by
          many as the key to all other phenomena presented in the material
          world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For one thing,
          the unreality of the data of sense after total abstraction of
          living mind, the chief Principle in the earlier works, lies more in
          the background in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De Motu</span></span>. Yet it is tacitly
          assumed, as the basis of an argument for the powerlessness of all
          sensible things, and for refunding all active power in the universe
          into conscious agency. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Mens agitat

          Motu</span></span>. Then there is more frequent reference to
          scientific and philosophical authorities than in his more juvenile
          treatises. Plato and Aristotle are oftener in view. Italy seems to
          have introduced him to the physical science of Borelli and
          Torricelli. Leibniz, who died in 1716, when Berkeley was in Italy,
          is named by him for the first time in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          Motu</span></span>. Perhaps he had learned something when he was
          abroad about the most illustrious philosopher of the time. And it
          is interesting by the way to find in one of those years what is, I
          think, the only allusion to Berkeley by Leibniz. It is contained in
          one of the German philosopher's letters to Des Bosses, in 1715.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Qui in Hybernia corporum <span class=

          writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“videtur nec rationes afferre
          idoneas, nee mentem suam satis explicare. Suspicor esse ex eo
          hominum genere qui per Paradoxa cognosci volunt.”</span> This
          sentence is interesting on account of the writer, although it
          suggests vague, and perhaps second-hand knowledge of the Irishman
          and his principles. The name of Hobbes does not appear in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          Motu</span></span>. Yet one might have expected it, in
          consideration of the supreme place which motion takes in his
          system, which rests upon the principle that all changes in the
          universe may be resolved into change of place.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De

          a protest against the empty abstractions, and consequent frivolous
          discussions, which even mechanical science had countenanced
          although dealing with matters so obvious to sense as the phenomena
          of motion. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          terms connected with motion, to which nothing in what is presented
          to the senses is found to correspond. Yet corporeal power is spoken
          of as if it were something perceptible by sense, and so found
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">within</span></em> the bodies we see and touch
          (sect. 1-3).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it turns out
          differently when philosophers and naturalists try to imagine the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical
          force</span></em> that is supposed to inhabit bodies, and to
          explain their motions. The conception of motion has been the parent
          of innumerable paradoxes and seeming contradictions among ancient
          Greek thinkers; for it presents, in a striking form, the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page492">[pg 492]</span><a name=
          "Pg492" id="Pg492" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> metaphysical
          difficulties in the way of a reconciliation of the One and the
          Many—difficulties which Berkeley had already attributed to perverse
          abstractions, with which philosophers amused themselves and blocked
          up the way to concrete knowledge; first wantonly raising a dust,
          and then complaining that they could not see. Nor has modern
          mechanical science in this respect fared better than the old
          philosophies. Even its leaders, Torricelli, for instance, and
          Leibniz, offer us scholastic shadows—empty metaphysical
          abstractions—when they speak about an active power that is supposed
          to be lodged within the things of sense. Torricelli tells us that
          the forces within the things around us, and within our own bodies,
          are <span class="tei tei-q">“subtle quintessences, enclosed in a
          corporeal substance as in the enchanted vase of Circe”</span>; and
          Leibniz speaks of their active powers as their <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“substantial form,”</span> whatever that can be
          conceived to mean. Others call the power to which change of place
          is due, the hylarchic principle, an appetite in bodies, a
          spontaneity inherent in them; or they assume that, besides their
          extension, solidity, and other qualities which appear in sense,
          there is also something named force, latent in them if not
          patent—in all which we have a flood of words, empty of concrete
          thought. At best the language is metaphorical (sect. 2-9).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For showing the
          active cause at work in the production of motion in bodies, it is
          of no avail to name, as if it were a datum of sense, what is not
          presentable to our senses. Let us, instead, turn to the only other
          sort of data in realised experience. For we find only two sorts of
          realities in experience, the one sort revealed by our senses, the
          other by inward consciousness. We can affirm nothing about the
          contents of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bodies</span></em> except what our senses
          present, namely, concrete things, extended, figured, solid, having
          also innumerable other qualities, which seem all to depend upon
          change of place in the things, or in their constituent particles.
          The contents <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg
          493]</span><a name="Pg493" id="Pg493" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mind</span></em> or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spirit</span></em>,
          on the other hand, are disclosed to inner consciousness, which
          reveals a sentient Ego that is actively percipient and exertive.
          And it must be in the second of these two concrete revelations of
          reality, that active causation, on which motion and all other
          change depends, is to be found—not in empty abstractions, covered
          by words like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">power</span></em>, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">force</span></em>, or <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nisus</span></em>,
          which correspond to nothing perceived by the senses (sect. 21).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So that which we
          call body presents <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">within itself</span></em> nothing in which
          change of place or state can originate causally. Extension, figure,
          solidity, and all the other perceptible constituents of bodies are
          appearances only—passive phenomena, which succeed one another in an
          orderly cosmical procession, on which doubtless our pains and
          pleasures largely depend. But there is no sensibly perceptible
          power found among those sensuous appearances. They can only be
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">caused
          causes</span></em>, adapted, as we presuppose, to signify to us
          what we may expect to follow that appearance. The reason of their
          significance, i.e. of the constancy of their sequences and
          coexistences, must be sought for <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outside of
          themselves</span></em>. Experimental research may discover new
          terms among the correlated cosmical sequences or coexistences, but
          the newly discovered terms must still be only passive phenomena
          previously unperceived. Body means only what is presentable to the
          senses. Those who attribute to it something not perceptible by
          sense, which they call the force or power in which its motions
          originate, say in other words that the origin of motion is
          unknowable by sense (sect. 22-24).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turn now from
          things of sense, the data of perception, to Mind or Spirit, as
          revealed in inner consciousness. Here we have a deeper and more
          real revelation of what underlies, or is presupposed in, the
          passive cosmical procession that is presented to the senses. Our
          inward consciousness plainly shews the thinking being actually
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page494">[pg 494]</span><a name=
          "Pg494" id="Pg494" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">exercising</span></em> power to move its
          animated body. We find that we can, by a causal exertion of which
          we are distinctly conscious, either excite or arrest movements in
          bodies. In voluntary exertion we have thus a concrete example of
          force or power, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">producing</span></em> and not merely
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">followed
          by</span></em> motion. In the case of human volition this is no
          doubt conditioned power; nevertheless it exemplifies Power on a
          greater scale than human, even Divine power, universally and
          continuously operative, in all natural motions, and in the cosmical
          laws according to which they proceed (sect. 25-30).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus those who
          pretend to find force or active causation <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em>
          bodies, pretend to find what their sensuous experience does not
          support, and they have to sustain their pretence by unintelligible
          language. On the other hand, those who explain motion by referring
          it to conscious exertion of personal agents, say what is supported
          by their own consciousness, and confirmed by high authorities,
          including Anaxagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Newton,
          demonstrating that in Spirit only do we find power to change its
          own state, as well as the states and mutual relations of bodies.
          Motion in nature is God continuously acting (sect. 31-34). But
          physical science is conveniently confined to the order of the
          passive procession of sensuous appearances, including experiments
          in quest of the rules naturally exemplified in the motions of
          bodies: reasoning on mathematical and mechanical principles, it
          leaves the contemplation of active causation to a more exalted
          science (sect. 35-42).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all this it
          can hardly be said that Berkeley has in this adequately sounded the
          depths of Causation. He proclaims inability to find through his
          senses more than sequence of significant sensuous appearances,
          which are each and all empty of active power; while he apparently
          insists that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">has</span></em> found active power in the mere
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">feeling</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page495">[pg 495]</span><a name="Pg495" id="Pg495" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">of
          exertion</span></em>; which after all, as such, is only one sort of
          antecedent sign of the motion that is found to follow it. This is
          still only sequence of phenomena; not active power. But is not
          causation a relation that cannot be truly presented empirically,
          either in outer or inner consciousness? And is not the Divine order
          that is presupposed by us in all change, a presupposition that is
          inevitable in trustworthy intercourse with a changing universe;
          unless we are to confess <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">atheistically</span></em>, that our whole
          sensuous experience may in the end put us to utter confusion? The
          passive, uneasy feeling of strain, more or less involved in the
          effort to move our bodies and their surroundings, is no doubt apt
          to be confused with active causation; for as David Hume remarks,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the animal <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nisus</span></em>
          which we experience, though it can afford no accurate precise idea
          of power, enters very much into the vulgar, inaccurate idea which
          is formed of it.”</span> So when Berkeley supposes that he has
          found a concrete example of originating power in the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nisus</span></em>
          of which we are conscious when we move our bodies, he is surely too
          easily satisfied. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">nisus</span></em> followed by motion is,
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, only a natural sequence,
          a caused cause, which calls for an originating cause that is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> responsible for the
          movement. Is not the index to this absolutely responsible agency an
          ethical one, which points to a free moral agent as alone
          necessarily connected with, or responsible for, the changes which
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he
          can</span></em> control? Persons are causally responsible for their
          own actions; and are accordingly pronounced good or evil on account
          of acts of will that are not mere caused causes—passively dependent
          terms in the endless succession of cosmical change. They must
          originate in self, be absolutely self-referable, in a word
          supernatural issues of the personality. Moral reason implies that
          they are not determined <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ab
          extra</span></span>, and so points to moral agents as our only
          concrete examples of independent power; but this only so far as
          those issues go for which they are morally <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page496">[pg 496]</span><a name="Pg496" id="Pg496" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> responsible. Is not faith in the Universal
          Power necessarily faith-venture in the absolutely perfect and
          trustworthy moral agency of God?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          principle of Causation, in its application to change of place on
          the part of bodies and their constituent atoms, is the leading
          thought in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De Motu</span></span>, this essay also
          investigates articulately the nature of the phenomenon which we
          call <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">motion</span></em> (sect. 43-66). It assumes
          that motion is only an effect, seeing that no one who reflects can
          doubt that what is presented to our senses in the case of motion is
          altogether passive: there is nothing in the successive appearance
          of the same body in different places that involves action on the
          part of either of the moving or the moved body, or that can be more
          than inert effect (sect. 49). And all concrete motion, it is
          assumed, must be something that can be perceived by our senses.
          Accordingly it must be a perceptible <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relation between
          bodies</span></em>, as far as it is bodily: it could make no
          appearance at all if space contained only one solitary body: a
          plurality of bodies is indispensable to its appearance. Absolute
          motion of a solitary body, in otherwise absolutely empty space, is
          an unmeaning abstraction, a collocation of empty words. This leads
          into an inquiry about relative space as well as relative place, and
          the intelligibility of absolute space, place, and motion (sect.
          52-64).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Local motion is
          unintelligible unless we understand the meaning of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">space</span></em>.
          Now some philosophers distinguish between absolute space, which
          with them is ultimately the only real space, and that which is
          conditioned by the senses, or relative. The former is said to be
          boundless, pervading and embracing the material world, but not
          itself presentable to our senses; the other is the space marked out
          or differentiated by bodies contained in it, and it is in this way
          exposed to our senses (sect. 52). What must remain after the
          annihilation of all bodies in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page497">[pg 497]</span><a name="Pg497" id="Pg497" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> universe is relativeless, undifferentiated,
          absolute space, of which all attributes are denied, even its
          so-called extension being neither divisible nor measurable;
          necessarily imperceptible by sense, unimaginable, and
          unintelligible, in every way unrealisable in experience; so that
          the words employed about it denote <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>
          (sect. 53).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It follows that
          we must not speak of the real space which a body occupies as part
          of a space that is necessarily abstracted from all sentient
          experience; nor of real motion as change within absolute space,
          without any relation between bodies, either perceived or conceived.
          All change of place in one body must be relative to other bodies,
          among which the moving body is supposed to change its place—our own
          bodies which we animate being of course recognised among the
          number. Motion, it is argued, is unintelligible, as well as
          imperceptible and unimaginable, without some relation between the
          moving body and at least one other body: the truth of this is
          tested when we try to suppose the annihilation of all other bodies,
          our own included, and retain only a solitary globe: absolute motion
          is found unthinkable. So that, on the whole, to see what motion
          means we must rise above the mathematical postulates that are found
          convenient in mechanical science; we must beware of empty
          abstractions; we must treat motion as something that is real only
          so far as it is presented to our senses, and remain modestly
          satisfied with the perceived relations under which it then appears
          (sect. 65-66).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, is
          motion, thus explained, something that can be spoken of as an
          entity communicable from one body to another body? May we think of
          it as a datum of sense existing in the striking body, and then
          passing from it into the struck body, the one losing exactly as
          much as the other receives? (sect. 67). Deeper thought finds in
          those questions only a revival of the previously <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg 498]</span><a name="Pg498" id="Pg498"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> exploded postulate of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“force”</span> as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">something sensible</span></em>, yet distinct
          from all the significant appearances sense presents. The language
          used may perhaps be permitted in mathematical hypotheses, or
          postulates of mechanical science, in which we do not intend to go
          to the root of things. But the obvious fact is, that the moving
          body shews less perceptible motion, and the moved body more. To
          dispute whether the perceptible motion acquired is numerically the
          same with that lost leads into frivolous verbal controversy about
          Identity and Difference, the One and the Many, which it was
          Berkeley's aim to expel from science, and so to simplify its
          procedure and result. Whether we say that motion passes from the
          striking body into the struck, or that it is generated anew within
          the struck body and annihilated in the striking, we make virtually
          the same statement. In each way of expression the facts remain,
          that the one body presents perceptible increase of its motion and
          the other diminution. Mind or Spirit is the active cause of all
          that we then see. Yet in mechanical science—which explains things
          only physically, by shewing the significant connexion of events
          with their mechanical rules—terms which seem to imply the
          conveyance of motion out of one body into another may be pardoned,
          in consideration of the limits within which physical science is
          confined, and its narrower point of view. In physics we confine
          ourselves to the sensuous signs which arise in experience, and
          their natural interpretation, in all which mathematical hypotheses
          are found convenient; so that gravitation, for example, and other
          natural rules of procedure, are spoken of as <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes</span></em>
          of the events which conform to them, no account being taken of the
          Active Power that is ultimately responsible for the rules. For the
          Active Power in which we live, move, and have our being, is not a
          datum of sense; meditation brings it into light. But to pursue this
          thought would carry us beyond the physical laws of Motion (sect.
          69-72).</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg

          circularem quod attinet, putant multi, crescente motu vero
          circulari, corpus necessario magis semper magisque ab axe niti. Hoc
          autem ex eo provenit, quod, cum motus circularis spectari possit
          tanquam in omni momento a duabus directionibus ortum trahens, una
          secundum radium, altera secundum tangentem; si in hac ultima tantum
          directione impetus augeatur, tum a centro recedet corpus motum,
          orbita vero desinet esse circularis. Quod si æqualiter augeantur
          vires in utraque directione, manebit motus circularis, sed
          acceleratus conatu, qui non magis arguet vires recedendi ab axe,
          quam accedendi ad eundem, auctas esse. Dicendum igitur, aquam in

          applicatis novis viribus in directione tangentis ad quamvis
          particulam aquæ, eodem instanti non applicentur novæ vires æquales
          centripetæ. Ex quo experimento nullo modo sequitur, motum absolutum
          circularem per vires recedendi ab axe motus necessario dignosci.

          tanquam a directionibus rectilineis infinitis ortum ducens, quæ

          Nam si vera rerum natura potius quam abstracta mathesis spectetur,

          corporum, quam actionem, esse utrobique æqualem. Exempli gratia,
          lapis fune equo alligatus tantum trahitur versus equum, quantum
          equus versus lapidem: corpus etiam motum in aliud quiescens
          impactum, patitur eandem mutationem cum corpore quiescente. Et
          quoad effectum realem, percutiens est item percussum, percussumque
          percutiens. Mutatio autem illa est utrobique, tam in corpore equi
          quam in lapide, tam in moto quam in quiescente, passio mera. Esse
          autem vim, virtutem, aut actionem corpoream talium effectuum vere

          impingitur; loquimur tamen active, dicentes illud hoc impellere:

          Berkeley the philosopher was born, and when the Duke of Ormond was
          Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The writer was probably the Hon. and
          Rev. George Berkeley, a Prebendary of Westminster in 1687, who died
          in 1694. The wife of the <span class="tei tei-q">“pious Robert
          Nelson”</span> was a daughter of Earl Berkeley, and this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“George”</span> was her younger

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gent.
          Mag.</span></span> (vol. XXII. p. 12), <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Anti-Berkeley”</span> thus argues the case of one born
          blind. <span class="tei tei-q">“This man,”</span> he adds,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“would, by being accustomed to feel one
          hand with the other, have perceived that the extremity of the hand
          was divided into fingers—that the extremities of these fingers were
          distinguished by certain hard, smooth surfaces, of a different
          texture from the rest of the fingers—and that each finger had
          certain joints or flexures. Now, if this man was restored to sight,
          and immediately viewed his hand before he touched it again, it is
          manifest that the divisions of the extremity of the hand into
          fingers would be visibly perceived. He would note too the small
          spaces at the extremity of each finger, which affected his sight
          differently from the rest of the fingers; upon moving his fingers
          he would see the joints. Though therefore, by means of this lately
          acquired sense of seeing, the object affected his mind in a new and
          different manner from what it did before, yet, as by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">touch</span></em>
          he had acquired the knowledge of these several divisions, marks,
          and distinctions of the hand, and, as the new object of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sight</span></em>
          appeared to be divided, marked, and distinguished in a similar

          his hand</span></em>, that the thing which he now saw was

          as the dependence of the other primary qualities was illustrated by
          their dependence on the organisation of the percipient. In this,
          the preceding, and the following sections, Berkeley argues the

          only the sensible measure thereof, as Mr. Locke and others think.
          But in these matters every man is to think for himself, and speak
          as he finds. One of my earliest inquiries was about <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>;
          which led me into several paradoxes that I did not think it fit or
          necessary to publish, particularly into the notion that the
          resurrection follows the next moment after death. We are confounded
          and perplexed about time—supposing a succession in God; that we
          have an abstract idea of time; that time in one mind is to be
          measured by succession of ideas in another mind: not considering
          the true use of words, which as often terminate in the will as in
          the understanding, being employed to excite and direct action
          rather than to produce clear and distinct ideas.”</span> Cf.

          new conception of the reality of matter, to the final human
          question of the self-conscious existence of the individual human
          Ego, after physical death. Philosophers and theologians were
          accustomed in his generation to ground their argument for a future
          life on the metaphysical assumption of the physical indivisibility
          of our self-conscious spirit, and on our contingent connexion with
          the body. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our bodies,”</span> says Bishop

          of Panegoism or Solipsism. Is this consistent with his conception
          of the reality of the material world? It is objected (e.g. by Reid)
          that ideal realism dissolves our faith in the existence of other
          persons. The difficulty is to shew how appearances presented to my
          senses, which are sensuous and subjective, can be media of
          communication between persons. The question carries us back to the
          theistic presupposition in the trustworthiness of experience—which
          is adapted to deceive if I am the only person existing. With
          Berkeley a chief function of ideas of sense is to signify other

            il prétend prouver en même tems l'insuffisance de l'un et de
            l'autre. La Vignette qu'on voit à la téte du Dialogue, fait
            allusion à cet objet. Elle représente un Philosophe dans son
            cabinet, lequel est distrait de son travail par un enfant qu'il
            appercoit se voyant lui-méme dans un miroir, en tendant les mains
            pour embrasser sa propre image. Le Philosophe rit de l'erreur où
            il croit que tombe l'enfant; tandis qu'on lui applique à lui-même
            ces mots tirés d'Horace:</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Le second Dialogue est employé à exposer le
            sentiment de l'Auteur sur le même sujet, sçavoir, que les choses
            corporelles ont une existence réelle dans les esprits qui les
            apperçoivent; mais qu'elles ne sçauroient exister hors de tous
            les esprits à la fois, même de l'esprit infini de Dieu; et que
            par conséquent la Matière, prise suivant l'acception ordinaire du
            mot, non seulement n'existe point, mais seroit même absolument
            impossible. On a taché de représenter aux yeux ce sentiment dans
            la Vignette du Dialogue. Le mot grec νοῦς qui signifie <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">âme</span></em>,
            désigne l'àme: les rayons qui en partent marquent l'attention que
            l'âme donne à des idées ou objets; les tableaux qu'on a placés
            aux seuls endroits où les rayons aboutissent, et dont les sujets
            sont tirés de la description des beautés de la nature, qui se
            trouve dans le livre, représentent les idées ou objets que l'âme
            considère, pas le secours des facultes qu'elle a reçues de Dieu;
            et l'action de l'Étre suprème sur l'âme est figurée par un trait,
            qui, partant d'un triangle, symbole de la Divinité, et perçant
            les nuages dont le triangle est environné. s'étend jusqu'à l'âme
            pour la vivifier; enfin, on a fait en sorte de rendre le même
            sentiment par ces mots:</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

            difficultés auxquelles le sentiment qu'on a établi dans les
            Dialogues précédens, peut être sujet, de l'éclaircir en cette
            sorte de plus, d'en développer toutes les heureuses conséquences,
            enfin de faire voir, qu'étant bien entendu, il revient aux
            notions les plus communes. Et comme l'Auteur exprime à la fin du
            livre cette dernière pensée, en comparant ce qu'il vient de dire,
            à l'eau que les deux Interlocuteurs sont supposés voir jaillir
            d'un jet, et qu'il remarque que la même force de la gravité fait
            élever jusqu'à une certaine hauteur et retomber ensuite dans le
            bassin d'où elle étoit d'abord partie; on a pris cet emblême pour
            le sujet de la Vignette de ce Dialogue; on a représenté en
            conséquence dans cette dernière Vignette les deux Interlocuteurs,
            se promenant dans le lieu où l'Auteur les suppose, et

          perceive be only ideas, it is impossible that two or more such
          minds can perceive the same thing. Thus there is one unconfutable
          consequence of Berkeley's system, which he seems not to have
          attended to, and from which it will be found difficult, if at all
          possible, to guard it. The consequence I mean is this—that,
          although it leaves us sufficient evidence of a Supreme Mind, it
          seems to take away all the evidence we have of other intelligent
          beings like ourselves. What I call a father, or a brother, or a
          friend, is only a parcel of ideas in my own mind ; they cannot
          possibly have that relation to another mind which they have to
          mine, any more than the pain felt by me can be the <em class=

              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The

              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp

              "tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the
              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=

              "font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate
